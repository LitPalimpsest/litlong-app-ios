The reserve of the one \u2014 the result of a natm-al modesty, and of a strict training according to the rules of the wisest of men\u2014 set off the freedom of the other as little better than forwardness; while her excellent sense, and an inborn susceptibility of the finest and purest feelings of the sex, whether stirred by the flowers of the field arrayed in their simple beauties, or the heaven-born genius of virtue working its pleasant ways in the hearts of man, brought out, by a contrast dangerous to her friend, the defects of a character that Wallace, iu his first blindness, had taken for perfections.
