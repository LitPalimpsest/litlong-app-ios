Our route to church was a lane called Windmill Lane, which had many stables in it; this lane is bisected by a cross street called Windmill Street, at the eastern end whereof there is a junction of several streets, of which the narrowest and dingiest is the Potterrow. At the top of the Potterrow is a lane at the back of the College, which led to another lane called the Horse Wynd, which descended to the Cowgate.    "}]
