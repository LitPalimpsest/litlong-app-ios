In Peter Williamson's \"Edinburgh Directory\" of 1786-88, his address is given as Argyle Square \u2014 which is near the University, and which disappeared on the construction of Chambers Street \u2014 and this fact led to the inference that the meeting must have occurred in that place, as Burns was in Edinburgh during the winter of 1786-87. But Scott himself speaks of Ferguson as living in an insulated house some distance from the town (Argyle Square was almost in the heart of the city) ; in a biographical sketch of Ferguson, printed in \"The Transactions of the Edinburgh Royal Society\" (1861-64), the writer says he lived at that time \" in a suburb called the Sciennes;\" Henry Cockburn in his \"Memorials\" says, \" Old Adam Ferguson lived just east of my father's house,\" which would point clearly to the neighborhood of the Sciennes ; and to crown all, Mr. Archibald Munro, in a letter to one of the Edinburgh  papers published about ten years ago, says    "},{"title":"Autobiography and personal recollections of John B.

We saw the tablet on Number 8 Chambers Street, which marks the approximate  site of his birthplace ; and we journeyed to George Square, where under his parents' roof he passed his boyhood  and early manhood, and to the lodgings at 108 George Street, whither he carried home his bride. The house Number 3 Walker Street, which he took for the winter of 1826, and which he described as comfortable and convenient, stands to-day as it stood in his time, and looks none the worse for wear ; but the lodgings at 6 St. David's Street, which he went to in May, 1826, just after the crash the place where \" the insects were voracious,\" and the cheese was a \" choke-dog concern \" are now no more ; and when we sought out \" Mrs. Jobson' s house,\" 6 Shandwick Place, his last fixed residence in Edinburgh, we felt grave doubts as to its authenticity.
