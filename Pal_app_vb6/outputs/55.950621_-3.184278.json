The opposite party retaliated by erecting a battery in the Blackfriars, (the old High School Yard), from which they greatly damaged the houses in the Canongate, while the Nether Bow Port was built up with stone and lime, the more effectually to exclude them from the usual place of meeting.

This \" slicht of weir\" is thus narrated by the contemporary diarist already quoted :\u2014Upon the 22d day of August 1571, my Lord Regent and the nobles professing the King's authority, seeing they could not obtain entry into the burgh of Edinburgh, caused several bands of soldiers to proceed from Leith during the night, and conceal themselves in the closes and adjoining houses immediately without the Nether Bow Port, while a considerable reserve force was collected at the Abbey, ready on a concerted signal from their trumpets to hasten to their aid. On the following morning, about five o'clock, when it was believed the night watch would be withdrawn, six soldiers, disguised as millers, approached the Port, leading a file of horses laden with sacks of meal, which were to be thrown down as they entered, so as to impede the closing of the gates; and while they assailed the warders with weapons they wore concealed under their disguise, the men in ambush were ready to rush out and storm the town.

At the foot of the High Street, the lofty tower and spire of the Nether Bow Port terminated the vista, surmounting the old Temple Bar of Edinburgh, interposed between the city and the ancient burgh of Canongate.

This bill also enacted the demolition of the Nether Bow Port, and the disbanding of the city-guard. The Scottish members, however, exerted themselves effectually in opposing this unjust measure when it was sent down to the House of Commons, and by their means it was shorn of its most objectionable clauses, and the whole commuted to a fine of df?2000, imposed on the city for behalf of the Captain's widow.

The gates of the Nether Bow Port were fastened back to preserve the free access of the military to the city ; guards were established there; the trained bands were called out; grenadier companies quartered in the town and suburbs; and most effectual means taken to prevent the hanging of a second Porteous, if any such had existed.1 On the second day after his execution, the body of Porteous was interred in the Greyfriars churchyard,2 but the exact spot has long since ceased to be remembered.3    "},{"title":"Border Ghost Stories","author":"Pease, Howard","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/27449","placename":"Nether Bow Port","snippet":"Noiselessly I descended the stairs, let myself out by a low side window in the cellar, and made straight for the lodging of 'the Meenister.'

But while the citizens were still undetermined as to the terms of capitulation, the Nether Bow Port was unwarily opened to let a coach pass out, on which a party of Highlanders, who had reached the gate undiscovered, immediately rushed in and secured the city, took possession of the guard-house, and seized on the arms and ammunition belonging to the guard.

One of them, a curious specimen of the ancient timber-fronted lands, and with successive tiers of windows divided only by narrow pilasters, has recently been curtailed by a story in height and robbed of its most characteristic features, to preserve for a little longer what remains, while the house immediately to the east of Knox's, which tradition pointed out as the mansion of the noble family of Balmerinoch, has now disappeared, having literally tumbled to the ground.
