This church road had existed from a very early period, and is mentioned in the charter of David I. to Holyrood Abbey, in the description of the lands lying under the Castle.

Besides the high altar, there were in St Cuthbert's Church several altars, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, to St Anne, and other saints, of most of which no very accurate account is preserved. The ancient church was subjected to many vicissitudes, and greatly modified by successive alterations and repairs, so that comparatively little of the original fabric remained when the whole was demolished about the middle of last century, and the present huge unsightly barn erected in its stead.
