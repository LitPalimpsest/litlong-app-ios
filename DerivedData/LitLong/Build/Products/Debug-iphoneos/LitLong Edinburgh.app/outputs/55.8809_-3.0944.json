On the whole, he has been much better since we came to our home comforts than he was the two wet, dismal months we were at Viewfield, in which, however, we had some gleams of sweet scenery and much repose, and our going there I look upon as providential, since it has afforded us the opportunity  of rescuing the two poor girls who were the victims of their father's brutal tyranny. Through Miss Howell, I have got one of them a situation as nursery-governess.    "}]
