Thursday last, as I was going out to Arniston about mid-day in a single horse chaise, with Mr. Turnbull the minister along with me, in passing an empty hay cart betwixt Dalhousie 1 and Carrington, the cart horses, startled at the rattling of the chaise, ran away with the cart upon us, and the cartwheel, coming betwixt our wheel and the chaise, tumbled us, chaise, horse, and all topsie turvy, and dragged us a great way, chaise and all along the ground. I was pressed twofold below the chaise, by which my whole body, especially my breast, was most miserably bruised.

Lord Traquair, 1 when Chancellor of Scotland, built, it is said, at his own expense, the bridge across the river at the foot of the bank below the meeting of the Temple and Carrington waters, which I am now (1811) pulling down. 2 By old people the bridge was always called Traquair' s Bridge, his Lordship always riding through this road to Edinburgh.

In winter 1810, when the old road to Carrington was stopped, I extended the shrubbery round to the gardener's house, and planted the clump immediately  to the east of the house. 1 In 1763 there is in the factor's book an entry of a payment for lime for building  the new garden wall.

In the spring of 1739, Mr. Dundas, now Lord Arniston, and Mrs. Dundas, paid a visit to their relatives at Invergordon . 1 The road from Edinburgh to Arniston still was by Dalhousie and Carrington , and across Traquair's Bridge, below the meeting of the waters.

In the same way no roads or tracks are shown, with the exception of that from Edinburgh to Carrington, and thence by Castleton towards the Moorfoot Hills, although others are known to have then existed. The litigation has an interest from its bearing upon the farming customs of the day.
