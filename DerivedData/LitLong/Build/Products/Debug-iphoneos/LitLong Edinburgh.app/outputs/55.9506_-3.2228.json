How often and willingly do I not look again in fancy on Tummel, orManor, or the talking Airdle, or Dee swirling in its Lynn; on the brightburn of Kinnaird, or the golden burn that pours and sulks in the denbehind Kingussie! I think shame to leave out one of these enchantresses,but the list would grow too long if I remembered all; only I may notforget Allan Water, nor birch-wetting Rogie, nor yet Almond; nor, forall its pollutions, that Water of Leith of the many and well-namedmills--Bell's Mills, and Canon Mills, and Silver Mills; nor Redford Burnof pleasant memories; nor yet, for all its smallness, that namelesstrickle that springs in the green bosom of Allermuir, and is fed fromHalkerside with a perennial teacupful, and threads the moss under theShearer's Knowe, and makes one pool there, overhung by a rock, where Iloved to sit and make bad verses, and is then kidnapped in its infancyby subterranean pipes for the service of the sea-beholding city in theplain. From many points in the moss you may see at one glance its wholecourse and that of all its tributaries; the geographer of this Lilliputmay visit all its corners without sitting down, and not yet begin to bebreathed; Shearer's Knowe and Halkerside are but names of adjacentcantons on a single shoulder of a hill, as names are squandered (itwould seem to the inexpert, in superfluity) upon these uplandsheepwalks; a bucket would receive the whole discharge of the toy river;it would take it an appreciable time to fill your morning bath; for themost part, besides, it soaks unseen through the moss; and yet for thesake of auld lang syne, and the figure of a certain _genius loci_, I amcondemned to linger awhile in fancy by its shores; and if the nymph (whocannot be above a span in stature) will but inspire my pen, I wouldgladly carry the reader along with me.
