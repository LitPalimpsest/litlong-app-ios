On the other hand there was always the Register Office in Victoria Street, which presumably had no arrangements for music, not  even a tape recorder. She imagined that the Register Office would be fairly similar to Warriston Crematorium,  both  being functional places run for the convenience of citizens by well-meaning bureaucrats; both with no time for too much fuss; both dedicated, in the final analysis, to  changing the  status of those whom  they served.

We went in and spent an hour there, wandering allround the nave and aisles, admiring the grand old edifice itself, butfinding more to smile at than to admire in the monuments. . . .
