And FOUNTAINHALL is prime, two big folio volumes, and all dreary, and all true, and all as terse as an obituary; and about one interesting fact on an average in twenty pages, and ten of them unintelligible for technicalities. There's literature, if you like!  It feeds; it falls about you genuine like rain.    "},{"title":"Old Mortality, Volume 1.","author":"Scott, Walter","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/6939","placename":"Fountainhall","snippet":"Captain Crichton, the friend of Dean Swift, who published his     Memoirs, found him a private gentleman in the King's Life-Guards. At     the same time this was no degrading condition; for Fountainhall     records a duel fought between a Life-Guardsman and an officer in the     militia, because the latter had taken upon him to assume superior     rank as an officer, to a gentleman private in the Life-Guards. The     Life-Guards man was killed in the rencontre, and his antagonist was     executed for murder.    "}]
