I stood on the highest crest of a long range of hills that rose gradually from the south, and swept away to the north till lost in a series of similar hills that checkered the distant landscape. On either hand a wild mountain valley lay far, far below me, and the hillsides plunged down with a precipitous descent; to the south lay the long gradual slope of the spine of the mountain up which I had ascended, and to the east a wide open valley, broad, level and fertile, stretched away to the heights of Stirling Castle, and far beyond this the eye ranged unconfined  to the bald summit of Arthur's Seat, and the beautiful town of Edina ; all else was a wild and desolate mountain view, whose hoary peaks shot up clear and sharp against the sky. Ben Lomond reared high his rocky head, the monarch of these dreary wastes ; the nearer mass of Ben Venue, and the rocky crest of Ben A'an, tossed up their giant heads in proud sublimity ; between them slept the glittering waters of Loch Katrine which gleamed and sparkled like an emerald in a waste and savage wilderness; Loch Achray, Loch Yennachar, and Loch Lubnaig, like a girdle of gems, encircled the base of the hill on which I stood ; to the east the lofty range of Uam-Var swept away in a long and winding curve, and the background was filled with a multitude of lofty hills, and over this extended landscape not a tree, not a shrub was to be detected, even with the glass, nothing but a scanty growth of stunted mountain moss, save that in the valleys here and there, light timber or small copses of brushwood lined the streams, and struggled up the hillsides,  but without attaining any considerable elevation.

Here he stopped for a minute, to look at the strange irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other, and twinkling afar off so high, that they looked like stars, gleaming from the castle walls on the one side and the Calton Hill on the other, as if they illuminated veritable castles in the air; while the old picturesque town slept heavily on, in gloom and darkness below: its palace and chapel of Holyrood, guarded day and night, as a friend of my uncle's used to say, by old Arthur's Seat, towering, surly and dark, like some gruff genius over the ancient city he has watched so long. I say, gentlemen, my uncle stopped here, for a minute, to look about him; and then, paying a compliment to the weather which had a little cleared up, though the moon was sinking, walked on again, as royally as before; keeping the middle of the road with great dignity, and looking as if he would very much like to meet with somebody who would dispute possession of it with him.
