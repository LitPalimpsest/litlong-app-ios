At     the same time this was no degrading condition; for Fountainhall     records a duel fought between a Life-Guardsman and an officer in the     militia, because the latter had taken upon him to assume superior     rank as an officer, to a gentleman private in the Life-Guards. The     Life-Guards man was killed in the rencontre, and his antagonist was     executed for murder.    "}]
