Wide is the prospect; and, as in general, we first turn to water, as the gem, the attraction, and the ornament of any landscape, however beautiful throughout, so here, in all probability, you first gaze on the wide inlet of tbe sea, called the Firth of Forth, with its expanse of waves, rolling towards you under a fresh northern breeze, and sparkling in the sun, and yet minute by minute assuming a different hue under the swiftly-coursing clouds of this glorious day. You mark its far-stretching reach as it penetrates the country towards the direction of Stirling, while the Bass rock at its mouth, with Inehkeith and Cramond Island, as nearer spots and features on its surface, will, probably, arrest your eye.
