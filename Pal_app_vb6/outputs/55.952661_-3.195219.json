[{"title":"A Tour in Tartan-Land","author":"Bede, Cuthbert","year":"1863-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-000247793","placename":"Romanes and Paterson","snippet":"No one can stroll down Princes Street and glance in at the shop windows, without being fully alive to the fact that he is in Tartan-land. Thus, the drapers' shops are gay with all manner of plaids; although there are some establishments \u2014 like that of Romanes and Paterson, on the North Bridge\u2014which are especially devoted to the Clan Tartans, and from whence you can emerge with all the necessary materials wherewith to convert yourself into a Highland chieftain of any known or fancy clan. Or, if your modesty shrinks from this, any tailor will rig you in a Tweed suit, whose colour shall harmonise with the natural tints of the glens and straths where your sport may lead you.    "}]
