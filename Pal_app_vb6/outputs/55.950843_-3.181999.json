A little farther to the eastward, and almost directly opposite the head of New Street, is the Playhouse Close, within the narrow alley of which the stage was established in 1747, on such a footing as was then deemed not only satisfactory, but highly creditable to the northern capital, where the drama had skulked about from place to place ever since its denouncement by the early reformers, finding even the patronage of royalty, and the favour of the vice-regal court of Holyrood, hardly sufficient to protect it from ignominious expulsion.

The theatre which in 1746 was erected in Playhouse Close in the Canongate, though only by a quibbling evasion of the statute, so Draconic were its provisions, was largely due to his energy and exertions.
