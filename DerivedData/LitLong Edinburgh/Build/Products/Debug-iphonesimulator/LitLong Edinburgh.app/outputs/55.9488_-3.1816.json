The knights of St John of Jerusalem, who succeeded to the forfeited possessions of the Templars, it is well-known held lands in almost every shire in Scotland, and claimed a jurisdiction, even within the capital, over certain tenements built on their ground, some of which, now remaining in the Grassmarket, still bear the name of Temple Lands.

The whole of this ground appears to have been ecclesiastical property in early times, and appropriated to various religious foundations, all of which were subject to the canons of Holyrood.3 St Leonard's Lane bounded it on the south, separating it on that side from the Borough Moor.
