We then moved into our first matrimonial home, which was a terraced house at the end of Craiglea Drive, in Morningside. It was not a large house, but it suited us very well, as we were on the sunny side of the street and got the morning sunlight through our drawing-room windows.

Betty and I spent many happy hours walking in those grounds when we lived in Craiglea Drive and when I drive past it today and reflect on those days I cannot help but feel a little bit sad. I think of those poor people who stayed there, and of all their unhappiness, and of how we used to look after people with rather greater dignity than we do today.

I know that some people have suggested that it was because we thought that that end of Craiglea Drive was not quite 'grand' enough for us, but that really was not the case and I'm happy to have this opportunity to scotch those rumours.

They had finished with his account of their courtship and early years in Craiglea Drive before they moved to the Braids.
