The Phoenix stands on an elevated column in the centre of the Park, and is an object  of admiration to the residents of the city and the first pointed out to strangers. The Hill of Howth, three or four miles out of Dublin, is six hundred feet high, extending into the water and guarding the entrance to the city.
