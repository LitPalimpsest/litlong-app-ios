[{"title":"Robert Burns and Mrs. Dunlop;","author":"Burns, Robert","year":"1898-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t7xk89c52","placename":"Carfrae","snippet":"I feel a great desire to see this address to you, and still more to hear if the sad story of its author touches those invisible threads that tremble over a birk-bud or a hawthorn bloom, and convey quick sensibility from their narrow base to their almighty original. Indeed, my good friend, if this produce not a few lines of heavenly song, you will disappoint me as much as it can Mr. Sherrif or Carfrae. Tho' at the same time that I do not think the last of these gentlemen devoid of taste, I own I do not build much on the approbation he bestows on, as it were, the last words of a long-known and much honoured friend, whose death would fall like a thunderclap, and must be long and warmly lamented by a whole county where he was idolized (although his genius was overlooked or uncomprehensible) for his modest, quiet, inoffensive, useful life, and honest, pious conversation, free from every arrogant, assuming air of importance or superiority,  either as a farmer or a scholar, in both which points the knowing considered him as eminent, but the latter of which was probably a bright beam that only hurt eyes unaccustomed  to behold its blaze when it chanced to be discover' d by his neighbours.
