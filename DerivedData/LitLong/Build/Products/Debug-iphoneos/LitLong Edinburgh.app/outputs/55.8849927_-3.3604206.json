DEAR SIR, When, after viewing the camp, you will remember  we were recounting at Balerno paper-mill, the number of mills that had been erected upon the Water of Leith, a small river of only 14 miles in length, which amounted to very near 100 of corn, barley, flour, and other mills. It was observed that very few falls on the water were left unoccupied, and these were all in the way of being immediatly taken up by mills now erecting for the paper manufacture, flax, and other modern improvements, by which not an inch of water would remain unemployed.

They were going to Balerno, were they? Balerno was a suburb in the west of Edinburgh, a place of well-set suburban homes, each planted squarely in a patch of garden, and each staring out on the world with windows that looked to all intents and purposes like two rectangular eyes.
