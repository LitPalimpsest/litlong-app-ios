Towards the close of last century, the mansion on the north side of the court was the residence of the eminent physician, Dr Cullen, while Lord Hades occupied the more ancient lodging on the south, before he removed to the modern dwelling erected for himself in New Street. The west side of the court was at one time the abode of Lord Belhaven ; and Lord Haining, the Countess of Stair, Douglas of Cavers, and other distinguished tenants, occupied this fashionable quarter of the town during the last century.

First a file of the TIMES for 18-; the police reports, the coroner's inquests, the passenger-list of the Sydney ship and of the American ship, inquiries at the lodging-house near the wharf--then to Edinburgh to inquire at the house in New Street, and consult with MacFarlane and Sinclair.

It still presents the aristocratic feature of a series of detached and somewhat elegant mansions.

Thirty-five years in a city like Edinburgh, with an eminently migrating population, is a far more unmanageable period than in a country town, where people inhabit the same houses from one generation to another, and where, even if the persons whom you wish to discover are dead, there are neighbours who recollect about them.

A little farther to the eastward, and almost directly opposite the head of New Street, is the Playhouse Close, within the narrow alley of which the stage was established in 1747, on such a footing as was then deemed not only satisfactory, but highly creditable to the northern capital, where the drama had skulked about from place to place ever since its denouncement by the early reformers, finding even the patronage of royalty, and the favour of the vice-regal court of Holyrood, hardly sufficient to protect it from ignominious expulsion.

One of them especially, immediately opposite to Moray House, is a very singular and striking object in the stately range of substantial stone tenements that extend from New Street to the Canongate Tolbooth. A highly adorned tablet surmounts the main entrance, enriched with angels' heads, and a border of Elizabethan ornament enclosing the Shoemakers' Arms, with the date 1677.

The Chapel of Ease in New Street, erected in 1794, now partly occupies its site. Several other interesting relics of the olden time were destroyed to make way for this ungainly ecclesiastical edifice.    "}]
