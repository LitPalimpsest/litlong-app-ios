[{"title":"Autobiography of the Rev. Dr. Alexander Carlyle, Minister of Inveresk,","author":"Carlyle, Alexander","year":"1860-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t9j38s62g","placename":"Newhailes","snippet":"After all the forms were gone through, and about a year had elapsed after the translation of Mr Frederick Carmichael to Edinburgh, I was ordained minister of Inveresk, on the 2d of August, O.S., 1748, by Mr Robert Paton, minister of Lasswade (as honest and gentlemanly a person as any of his cloth), with the almost universal goodwill of the parish. The only person of consideration who was not present at the ordination was Sir James Dalrymple of Newhailes, who had taken umbrage at his being refused the presentation, when he had applied for it to Gersham Carmichael, the brother of Frederick. He and his family, however, attended the church on the first Sunday after the ordination, when he came round and welcomed me to the parish, and invited me to dine with him next day, which I did, and continued ever after in perfect friendship with him till his death in 1751.
