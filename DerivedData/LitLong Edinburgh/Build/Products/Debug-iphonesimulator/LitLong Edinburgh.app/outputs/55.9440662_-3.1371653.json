In my early days he was a cloth merchant in the High Street.  His shop was very near that gigantic lounge, the old Parliament House, and was often resorted to by non-business visitors.  Bridges had a good taste for pictures.  He had a small but choice collection by the Old Masters, which he kept arranged in the warehouse under his shop.  He took great pride in exhibiting them to his visitors, and expatiating upon their excellence. I remember being present in his warehouse with my father when a very beautiful small picture by Richard Wilson was under review.  Davie burst out emphatically with, \"Eh, man, did ye ever see such glorious buttery touches as on these clouds!\"  His joking friends clubbed him \"Director-General of the Fine Arts for Scotland,\" a title which he complacently accepted.  Besides showing off his pictures, Davie was an art critic, and wrote articles for the newspapers and magazines. Unfortunately, however, his attention to pictures prevented him from attending to his shop, and his customers (who were not artists) forsook him, and bought their clothes elsewhere.  He accordingly shut up his shop, and devoted himself to art criticism, in which, for a time, he possessed a monopoly.  ...]    "},{"title":"Over-Sea; or, England, France and Scotland as seen by a live American ...
