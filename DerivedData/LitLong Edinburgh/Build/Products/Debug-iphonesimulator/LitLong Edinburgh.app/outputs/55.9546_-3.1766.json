A large section of the most persevering ofthe runners gained the top ofthe Abbey Hill, at the junction of the Regent Terrace, just as the royal cortege was approaching it; and as there were some splendid ranges of platform which had been erected to overlook the road, they seized possession of them without fee asked or given, almost as wildly as an infuriated soldiery would rush into a besieged town, and there were they gratified by the sight of the royal    "},{"title":"Here and there in the Home Land.

The only chance of obtaining a sight of the queen seemed to be to gain the top of the Abbey Hill, so that they might intercept the royal party at the end of Regent Terrace, before it passed on to Jock's Lodge, on the road to Dalkeith. The lord-provost's carriage took the lead, and, with every one else, and their name was legion, it became a hot-footed race, or scamper, of the most furious energy down the steep High-street and Canongate, and then skirting Holyrood, up the Abbey Hill\u2014a race, we should say (having run it), of fully a mile over the roughest turf imaginable.

But here he was on Regent Terrace; there was nothing to prevent him going round the end of the hill, and looking from without on the Mackenzies' house. As he went he reflected that Flora must now be a woman of near his own age, and it was within the bounds of possibility that she was married; but this dishonourable doubt he dammed down.
