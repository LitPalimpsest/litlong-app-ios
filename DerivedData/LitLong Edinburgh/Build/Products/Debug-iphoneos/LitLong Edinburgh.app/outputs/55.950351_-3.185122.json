A contemporary historian relates that \" the Regent, Johne Erie of Mar, for beseageing of the toun of Edinburgh, cawsit nyne pece of ordonance, great and small, be?

And with this worthy son of worthy sires lived his wife Janet, a Cameronian as well; yea, as true-blue a specimen of the hardfeatured yet noble-hearted sect as honest John himself.

It only remains to be mentioned of the Fountain Close, that it formed, at a very recent period, the only direct access from the High Street to the Cowgate Chapel, while that was the largest and most fashionable Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh.

Adam Fullarton speedily returned to his house at the Nether Bow; and while the English forces under Sir William Durie were casting up trenches and planting cannon for the siege of Edinburgh Castle, in the name of the young King, he was again chosen a burgess of the Parliament which assembled in the Tolbooth on the 26th of April 1573.3 This date corresponds with that carved on the lintel of the old mansion in the Fountain Close. It may be doubted, however, whether it indicates more than its repair, as it is expressly mentioned by the contemporary already quoted, that \" thaj did litill or na skaith to the said hous and platforme.\" * We can hardly doubt that this ancient tenement will be viewed with increasing interest by our local antiquaries, associated as it is with so important a period of national history.

He stopped before the Fountain Close, and peered into its dark depths. He wished to see it, but for a moment the repulsive aspect of this narrow cutting through the rotten houses held him back.
