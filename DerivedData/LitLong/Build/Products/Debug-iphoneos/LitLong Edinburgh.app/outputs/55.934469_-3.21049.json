I approve, therefore, very much the devotion of a studious  man at Christ Church, who was overheard in his oratory entering into a detail with God, acknowledging the divine goodness  in furnishing the world with makers of dictionaries! These men court same, as well as their betters, by such means as God has given them to acquire it; and Littleton exerted all the genius  he had when he made a dictionary, though Stephens did not. They deserve encouragement, however, whilst they continue to compile, and neither affect wit, nor presume to reason.    "},{"title":"The Story of My Life, volumes 4-6","author":"Hare, Augustus J. C.
