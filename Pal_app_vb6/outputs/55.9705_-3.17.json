In consequence the Library must, about this time, have been removed into the room above the late Session-House, attached to the High Church, where it remained until the building of an apse for an organ necessitated its removal in 1 89 1 to one of the rooms in the Female School, lately used as a Kindergarten School, in Academy Street. A new catalogue was made about the year 1794 ; another in 1868 by Messrs Allan and Alexander Macdonald, which was revised and had the new books added to it by Mr John Macechern in 1890 ; and a new catalogue was made by Mr George Alexander Wilson in 1891, w^hen the whole library was re-arranged, and found to consist of 2894 volumes, 21 volumes being missing.
