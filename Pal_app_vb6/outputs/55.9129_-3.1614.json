One royal abode, however, still remains\u2014if tradition is to be trusted,\u2014and forms a feature of peculiar interest among the antiquities of the Kirkgate. Entering by a low and narrow archway immediately behind the buildings on the east side, and about half-way between Charlotte Street and Coatfield Lane, the visitor finds himself in a singular looking, irregular, little court, retaining unequivocal marks of former magnificence.

The chief gate of the town was St Anthony's Port, where the walls intersected the Kirkgate ; and beyond this point no vestige of them has remained since the middle of the sixteenth century, although they extended thence to the river, and were continued on the opposite side, so as to enclose the more modern suburb that formed the nucleus of North Leith. No sooner was the treaty concluded which put an end to the siege of Leith, in 1560, than the fortifications that had been reared with so much labour and skill were ordered to be razed to the ground; the Council of the kingdom and the Magistrates of Edinburgh being too keenly impressed with a sense of their mischievous effects in the hands of an enemy, to appreciate the value of a stronghold as one of the keys of the kingdom, which had baffled the united forces of England and Scotland to compel its surrender.

The upper stories appear to have been erected about the end of the sixteenth century, and form rather a neat and picturesque specimen of the private buildings of that period.

Returning, however, to the ancient edifices of the Kirkgate, we must refer the reader to the view already given of one which was only demolished in 1845, and which, from its appearance, was undoubtedly one of the oldest private buildings in Leith.1 Popular fame, as was mentioned before, assigned its erection to Mary of Guise. The value to be attached to such traditional associations may be inferred from a remark in the most recent history of Leith:\u2014\" Were we to give credit to aU the traditionary information we have received, Mary of Lorraine would appear to have had in Leith not one place of residence, but at least a score, there being scarcely an old house in the town without its claims to the honour of having been the habitation of the Queen Regent.

They are represented in a perfect state, extending uninterruptedly from Bernard's Nook to the point of intersection at the Kirkgate, in a plan of Leith by Captain Greenville Collins, dedicated to Sir James Fleming, who was Provost of Edinburgh in 1681; and considerable remains of them were only cleared away in opening up Constitution Street and the neighbouring approaches, about thirty years since.
