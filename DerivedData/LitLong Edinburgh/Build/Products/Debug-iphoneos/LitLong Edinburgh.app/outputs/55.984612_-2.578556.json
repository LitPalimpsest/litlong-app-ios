Thence by Lochan, Sir John Warender's, Belton water mill, Mr. David Hay's : near which is a pretty good \"Change-house,\" as they call their inns and public houses here, but we had no occasion or temptation to stop at it ; near Teningham, Lord Haddington's, on the right, over Lentoun brigg cross a large stream running in a rocky bed, leaving Prestonhaugh Kirk to the right. Within a mile or thereabouts of Haddington we passed near two good houses and pretty plantations ; that on the high ground on the right hand is the Laird of Beenston's, that, on the bottom on the left, the Laird of Deenston's, and is an older plantation than that on the hill.

It formed, at a somewhat later date, the residence of Lord David Hay of Belton, to whom that barony was secured in succession by a charter granted to his father, John, second Earl of Tweeddale, in 1687- The locality, indeed, appears from the ancient deeds to have been one of honourable resort down to a comparatively recent period, as knights and men of good family occur among the occupants during the eighteenth century. The boundaries of the house are defined on the north \" by the stone tenement of land some time belonging to the Earl of Angus.\"    "},{"title":"The Lauderdale papers.","author":"Lauderdale, John Maitland","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=yale.39002001235242","placename":"Belton","snippet":"The prowast of Edenbr : & I have talkid of a desinge to have Edenbr : better plantid uith minesters to tak the peopel's minds of conventicles, uhich ar now ueal nigh quiet in that plac : and as it was the great art of thos desingid the lait troubels & rebellione to have trumpets to it sounding ther, that sam politike may serve now by putting in able men of a sund judgment to out preach the fanatiks, such as M.

We did not go into the town of Grantham, but passed close by it, leaving it on the right, and a little further came by a very good house of my Lord Tyrconnell's on our left called Belton, the seat of the Brownlows. There is a pretty avenue to it from the South, the trees it is planted with seem of different kinds and to have been planted at different times.
