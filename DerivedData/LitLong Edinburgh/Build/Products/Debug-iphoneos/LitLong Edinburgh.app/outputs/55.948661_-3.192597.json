Here Ferguson the poet, David Herd one of the earliest collectors of Scottish songs, \" antiquarian Paton,\" with others of greater note in their own day than now,\u2014lords of session, and leading advocates, inhabitants of the neighbouring fashionable district,\u2014were wont to congregate.

At that time, the writer states, \" few strangers omitted to call in to gaze at the coffin [?] of the bard ; this was a small dark room which could barely accommodate, even by squeez ing, half a dozen, but in which Burns used to sit.

Still another of the inns to which Ferguson went to \" get his cares and pother laid \" was Johnnie Dowie's Tavern, in Liber ton's Wynd, which was later a favorite resort of Burns, and which has been dubbed \"The Mermaid of Edinburgh.\" It was famous as the \" Burns Tav ern\" in the last years of its existence, and was long one of the architectural lions of the Old Town for Burns's sake ; but when George IV.

George Paton was a man of extreme modesty and diffidence,\u2014a bachelor of retiring and taciturn inclinations ;\u2014yet he was neither illiberal nor unsocial in his habits ; his time, his knowledge, and his library, were all at the service of his friends, and though not only temperate, but abstemious in his tastes, his evenings were generally spent with Herd, and other kindred spirits, in Johnie Dowie's Tavern, in Libberton's Wynd, the well known rendezvous of the Scottish literati during that period. He was methodical in all his habits,\u2014the moment eleven sounded from St Giles's steeple, his spare figure might be seen emerging from the wynd head, and the sound of his cane on the pavement of Lady Stair's Close, gave the signal to his housekeeper for his admittance.

His facetious talents furnished him with a ready passport to all classes of society, and thus it happened that he not unfrequently participated in the convivial evening gatherings at Dowie's Tavern.

What contributed, however, in no small degree, to the popularity of ' Johnnie Dowie's Tavern,' unquestionably was, in the first place, the good cheer which his house afforded ; and in the second, his own tact and address. He was uniformly attentive and obliging, and ever the sleekest and kindest of landlords.    "},{"title":"His Dearest Wish.
