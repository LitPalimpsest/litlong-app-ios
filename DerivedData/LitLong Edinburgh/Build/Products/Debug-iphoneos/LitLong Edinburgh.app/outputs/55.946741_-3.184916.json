In my sight it was rather an ordeal to be undergone than a triumph to be achieved, and I looked forward to it for a long time with a feeling of carelessness, which prevented me from seriously preparing for it ; and in addition, through the bygone summer, I was so thoroughly occupied with chemical speculations, that anything in the shape of anatomy or surgery filled me with disgust.
