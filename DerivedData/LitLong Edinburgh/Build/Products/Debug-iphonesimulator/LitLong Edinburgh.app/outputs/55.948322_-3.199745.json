The date 1614, which was cut on the east gable, probably marked the period at which the ruins of the choir were entirely cleared away.

They wreaked their vengeance on some defenceless fishing towns and villages along the coasts of the Frith, and then returned to England, where Archbishop Cranmer prepared a general thanksgiving to be used throughout all the churches in the kingdom, for the great victory God had vouchsafed them over their enemies ! So differently are the same actions estimated, according as our interests are affected; for the Duke of Somerset had so exasperated the Scottish nation by his cruelty, and disgusted even the barons who had inclined to the English party by his impolitic conduct, that they were more unanimous than ever against the proposed alliance.

The old tower of St Mary's Church, as engraved in our view of it, was another nearly similar, but that has been since taken down; and a destructive fire has this year demolished another similar erection at the Town Hall, Linlithgow. The site chosen for the second of the two churches projected in 1637, was the Castle Hill, on the ground now occupied by the Reservoir.

Here also is the boundary of South Leith Parish, in proof of which there might recently be seen carved and gilded in raised letters on a beam under the north-west gallery of St Mary's Church, Leith, \" For the Craig End, 1652.\" The engraving of St Ninian's Row will serve to convey some idea of the picturesque range of edifices dedicated of old to the Confessor, and swept away by the recent operations of the North British Railway.

It is token from the old east road, and owing to the nature of the ground, and the site of the town being chiefly a declivity towards the river, little more is seen than the nearest rows of houses, and the steeple of St Mary's Church. The rural character of the neighbouring downs, however, is curious, as well as a singular looking old-fashioned carriage which forms one of the most prominent objects in the view.

With these they kept up so constant and destructive a firing, that, in a few days, they not only dismounted the ordnance placed by the French in the steeple, but greatly injured it and the adjoining buildings.4 On the 14th of April, being Easter Sunday, a constant firing was kept up by the assailants, particularly at St Mary's Church, where the people were assembled for divine service, so that a bullet was shot through the great east window, passing right over the altar, during the celebration of high mass, and just before the elevation of the host. Two of the mounds thrown up by the besiegers on this occasion still remain on Leith Links, and almost directly opposite the east end of the church.

Other stone coffins' were discovered about the same time immediately opposite to St Mary's Church, in levelling the ground for the New Road ; 3 and similar evidences of the occupation of the district by native tribes at a very remote period are frequently met with all round Edinburgh. Several such were found in 1846, along the coast of Wardie, in excavating for the foundations of one of the bridges of the Granton Railway.

From the latter view, it would also appear to have been roofed with stone flags, and ornamented along the ridge with carved pinnacles, such as may still be seen on St Mary's Church at Leith. This church seems to have been applied to secular purposes soon after the Reformation.
