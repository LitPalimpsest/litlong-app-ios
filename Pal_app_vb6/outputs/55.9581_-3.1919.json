In 1721, the Treasurer of the Hospital complains of the expense incurred in prosecuting offenders in the case of some murders commitied within the regality; but these onerous and costly privileges were at length abrogated in 1746, by the act abolishing heritable jurisdictions, and the Governors a few years afterwards granted the use of the Tolbooth to one of their tenants as a storehouse, \" reserving to the Hospital a room for holding their baron courts when they shall think fit.\"2 The last occasion on which Old Broughton was directly associated with any event of public importance, was during the memorable campaign of 1650, which preceded the battle of Dunbar, when General Leslie made it his head quarters, while he threw up the line of defence from the base of the Calton Hill to Leith, which we have already described as the origin of the great causeway that now forms the chief thoroughfare between Edinburgh and Leith.

His voice had long been mute, not as that of Elihu, who trembled to speak to the Lord, but as that of those v\/ho lie in the mould till that day when there shall be no hindrance by the chilling hand of death, to sing the praises of the King of heaven    "},{"title":"James Nasmyth, Engineer: An Autobiography","author":"Nasmyth, James","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/476","placename":"Old Broughton","snippet":"Another of my favourite workshop lieutenants was James Hutton.

In order to proceed with the construction of my machine tools, I rented a small piece of land at Old Broughton. It was at the rear of my worthy friend George Douglass's small foundry, and was only about five minutes' walk from my father's house.    "}]
