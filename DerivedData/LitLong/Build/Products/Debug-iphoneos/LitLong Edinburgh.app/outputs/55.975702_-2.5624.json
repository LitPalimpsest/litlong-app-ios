The road betweenBelton and Chillingham is a beautiful one, passingthrough wild open country with views bounded by theCheviots. On arriving, I was shown into a room with awindow deep in the old masonry of the tower, the walls ofthis room covered with tapestry, of which two large panelsare interesting, representing the sea and the earth in theforms of Neptune and Amphytrite.

His scenes of unmixed horror, as thedeaths of Belton and of the infamous Sinclair, areas dreadful as the former are elevating ; and theyare directed to the same noble purpose, increasingour fear and hatred of vice, as the former are qualified to augment our love and veneration of virtue. In this respect Fielding might have paid to Richardson's genius the just tribute, which, after muchdepreciation of his talents in other respects, Dryden rendered to Otway\u2014\" Yet he succeeds inmoving the passions, which I cannot do.\"    "}]
