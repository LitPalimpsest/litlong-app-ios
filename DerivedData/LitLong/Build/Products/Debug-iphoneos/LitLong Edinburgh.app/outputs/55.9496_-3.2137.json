The house Number 3 Walker Street, which he took for the winter of 1826, and which he described as comfortable and convenient, stands to-day as it stood in his time, and looks none the worse for wear ; but the lodgings at 6 St. David's Street, which he went to in May, 1826, just after the crash the place where \" the insects were voracious,\" and the cheese was a \" choke-dog concern \" are now no more ; and when we sought out \" Mrs. Jobson' s house,\" 6 Shandwick Place, his last fixed residence in Edinburgh, we felt grave doubts as to its authenticity. It seemed impossible that the house we saw could date back to Sir Walter's time.    "},{"title":"Autobiography and personal recollections of John B.

With this end, New York has been visited; where, commencing  at the Croton Hotel, by an interview with its gentlemanly proprietor,  the investigation was pursued to Thompson's, where, as is represented, they first stopped for soda ; through Broadway and Chambers  Street, to the shop in which it was probably drank; then, in company  with Officer Hayes, to the bouse in Walker Street, with as full an examination into the circumstances of his connection with that dwelling, and his rescue from it, as could be made by conversation with the women who inhabit it, and the officer who conveyed him to the hospitable mansion of Mr. Hurlbut, at Brooklyn. That gentleman, who so humanely nursed and sheltered him, made a minute statement of the manner in which he was brought to his dwelling, the state he was in while there, and his condition on leaving.
