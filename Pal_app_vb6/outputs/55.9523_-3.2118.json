There was not a soul in Randolph Crescent, nor a soul in Queensferry Street; in this outdoor privacy and the sense of escape, John took heart again ; and with a pathetic sense of leave-taking he even ventured up the lane and stood a while, a strange peri at the gates of a quaint paradise, by the west end of St. George's Church. They were singing within; and by a strange chance the tune was ' St. George's, Edinburgh,' which bears the name, and was first sung in the choir, of that church.    "},{"title":"Works of R. L.

This was the day of reunited families, the day to which he had so long looked forward, thinking to awake in his own bed in Randolph Crescent, reconciled with all men and repeating the footprints of his youth; and here he was alone, pacing the alleys of a wintry garden and filled with penitential thoughts.

John's pass-key was a recent privilege ; this was the first time it had been used; and, O ! with what a sickening sense of his unworthiness he now inserted it into the well-oiled lock and entered that citadel of the proprieties! All slept; the gas in the hall had been left faintly burning to light his return; a dreadful stillness reigned, broken by the deep ticking of the eightday clock.

I heard much of him then, though I only won his intimacy years afterwards.    "},{"title":"Works of R. L. Stevenson. (Edinburgh edition.)

And when he entered his own house in Randolph Crescent (south side), and shut the door behind him, his heart swelled with security. Here, at least, was a citadel unassailable by right-hand defections or left-hand extremes.    "},{"title":"Works of R. L. Stevenson. (Edinburgh edition.)

Yes, he knew them; but when ? and how ? Long since, he thought; and then, casting his eye through the front glass, which had been recently occluded by the figure of the jarvey, he beheld the tree-tops of the rookery in Randolph Crescent. He was close to home\u2014home, where he had thought, at that hour, to be sitting in the wellremembered drawing-room in friendly converse; and instead !    "},{"title":"Works of R. L. Stevenson.

In the midst of these, imagine that natural, clumsy, unintelligent and mirthful animal, John; mighty well-behaved in comparison with many lads, although not up to the standard of the house in Randolph Crescent; full of a sort of blundering affection, full of caresses which were never very warmly received; full of sudden and loud laughters which rang out in that still house like curses. Mr. Nicholson himself had a great fund of humour, of the Scots order\u2014intellectual, turning on the observation of men ; his own character, for instance, if he could have seen it in another, would have been a rare feast to him; but his son's empty guffaws over a broken plate, and    "}]
