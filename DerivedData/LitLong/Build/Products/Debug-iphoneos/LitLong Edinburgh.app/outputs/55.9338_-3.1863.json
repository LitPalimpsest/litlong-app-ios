But apart from this undoubted convenience, what suited him about Dick Place was the leafy quiet of the garden that surrounded the house on all four sides. If they were to pass any comment on Dr Macgregor's garden, John Gifford and his friends might be sniffy about the small stone conservatory and potting shed, with its fluted and rusticated mullions; they might even describe the whole thing as \"an oddity\", but for Dr Macgregor it was his sanctuary, the place where he might in perfect and undisturbed peace sit and read the Journal of the Royal College of Psychiatry or the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.

But Dick Place is not distinguished only by architectural exuberance; like so many streets in Edinburgh, it has its famous sons. At its junction with Findhorn Place is the house in which the inventor of the digestive biscuit once lived; not the only house in Edinburgh to be associated with baking distinction \u2013 in West Castle Road, in neighbouring Merchiston, there once lived the father of the modern Jaffa Cake, a confection which owed its name to the viscous orange jelly lurking under the upper coating of chocolate.

That description had struck him forcibly when he had opened the copy of that work given to him by Pat as a birthday present some years earlier, and discovered that his house in Dick Place, along with others like it, was a polite villa. It was at the same time both dispiriting and reassuring; dispiriting in the sense that to live in a polite villa implied that one's life was rather dull: the connection between building style and personality type may not be a necessary one, but it nonetheless exists in many cases, whether as cause or effect \u2013 that might be difficult to tell.

Dick Place, they write in their guide to the buildings of Edinburgh, is a street of \"polite villas\" \u2013 a description which may fairly be applied to vast swathes of Edinburgh suburbia.
