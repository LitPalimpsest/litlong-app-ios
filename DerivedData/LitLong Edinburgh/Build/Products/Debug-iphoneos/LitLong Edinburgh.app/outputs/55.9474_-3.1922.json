This, we presume, to be the Cunzie nook referred to above, a place where the Mint had no doubt been established at some early period, possibly during some of the strange proceedings in the Regency of Mary of Guize,2    "},{"title":"Scottish eccentrics","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/81908351","placename":"Candlemaker Row","snippet":"Usually when Hogg went to Edinburgh, on his last night before returning to Yarrow he would give a party. Robert Chambers was present at one at least of these feasts and has left a lively description of it: \"In the course of the forenoon, he [Hogg] would make a round of calls, and mention in the most incidental possible way, that two or three of his acquaintances were to meet that night in the Candlemaker Row at nine, and that the addition of this particular friend whom he was addressing, together with any of his friends he chose to bring along with him, would by no means be objected to. It may readily be imagined that, if he gave this kind of invitation to some ten or twelve individuals, the total number of his visitors would not probably be few.

He took a walk with me every day, generally to the Candlemaker Row; but he was sombre and mild; declined doing battle, though som'e fit cases offered, and indeed submitted to sundry indignities; and was always very ready to turn and came faster back, and trotted up the stair with much lightness, and went straight to that door.

Here was the residence of Dr Austin, already referred to, in a house still standing at the north-west corner, and a few doors from this, in the building on the west side through which the arched entry led into Candlemaker Row, dwelt for above twenty years Miss Jeanie Elliot, the author of the beautiful version of the \" Flowers o' the Forest,\" beginning, \" I've heard them Jilting at the ewe-milking.\" She was a daughter of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto, and is described by a contemporary as \"a remarkably agreeable old maiden lady, with a prodigious fund of Scottish anecdote.\"    "}]
