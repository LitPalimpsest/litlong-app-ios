Even beforehe graduated, and whilst a student in the Royal Infirmaryof Edinburgh, he delivered lectures on Diagnosis, andpublished reviews and essays in periodical journals. From that period to the present time, a space of nearlythirty years, he has been a most diligent and laboriouscultivator of almost every branch of medical science, ashis works, which speak for themselves, amply testify.
