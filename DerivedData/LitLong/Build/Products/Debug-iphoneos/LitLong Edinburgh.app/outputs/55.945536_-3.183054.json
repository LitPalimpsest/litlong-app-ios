These good people thought,partly because of their deep sense of their own importance, and partly bya trick of sympathy which I had, and most genuiue it was, that I wasinterested beyond measure in them and their ways, whereas it was in IrvingI was interested, and listening with all my ears to hear about him, and muchless concerned about the Holy Apostolic Church. They were disappointedaccordingly, and not pleased with the book.    "}]
