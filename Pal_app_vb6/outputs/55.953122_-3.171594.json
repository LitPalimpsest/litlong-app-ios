The prevalence of Norman remains among such of the ancient parish churches of Mid-Lothian as still retain any of their original masonry, proves that a very general impetus had been given to ecclesiastical architecture about the period of the founding of Holyrood Abbey, in the 12th century. This entirely accords with what is usually found in the architectural chronology of any populous district in the neighbourhood of an important ecclesiastical foundation ; and, indeed, the history of the erection of St Giles's Church is almost entirely comprised in three periods, each of which was marked by the founding of other ecclesiastical buildings.
