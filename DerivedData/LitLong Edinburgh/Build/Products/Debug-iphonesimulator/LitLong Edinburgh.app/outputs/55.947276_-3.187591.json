[{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Collegiate Church of St Mary in the Fields","snippet":"Beyond the arch of the bridge, from whence the busy crowds of the modern city look down on this deserted scene of former magnificence, we again come to antique memorials of other times. Here is a steep and straitened alley ascending towards the southern side of the town, which formed in remote times the avenue to the Collegiate Church of St Mary in the Fields; and at a more recent, though still early, period, the public approach to the Old College of Edinburgh. This ancient avenue possesses interesting associations with successive generations, from the period when Dominicans and Greyfriars, and the priests and choristers of St Mary's College, clamb the steep ascent, down to a time, just gone by, when grave professors and wily practitioners of the law shared among them its flats and common stairs.
