Two mounted figures are introduced in the foreground, riding apparently over the ridge of St Leonard's Hill, along the ancient Dumbiedyke's Road, towards the town. The date of the view is ascertainable from the introduction of the Weigh House steeple, demolished by Cromwell in 1650, and the spire of the.Tron Church, which was completed about 1663, although the church was so far advanced in 1647 as to be used as a place of worship.

The drawing-room to the south, the windows of which command a beautiful and uninterrupted view of Salisbury Crags and St Leonard's Hill, has its walls very tastefully decorated with a series of designs of landscapes and allegorical figures, with rich borders    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"St Leonard's Hill","snippet":"The first is inscribed, Vrbis Edin\u00e6 Facies Meridionalis\u2014The Prospect oftlie South Side of Edinburgh.
