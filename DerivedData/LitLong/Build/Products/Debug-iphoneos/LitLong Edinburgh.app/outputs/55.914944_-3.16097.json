The first, not heather, for that is too luscious, especially after such cream, but the pure white virgin honey, like dew shaken from clover, but now qucrny after winter keep ; and oh ! over a layer of such butter on such barley-bannocks  was such honey, on such a day, in such company, and to such palates, too divine to be described by such a pen as that now wielded by such a writer ! The Jam ! It was of gooseberries  \u2014 the small black hairy ones \u2014 gathered to a very minute from the bush, and boiled to a very moment in the pan ! A bannock studded  with some dozen or two of such grozets was more beautiful than a corresponding Expanse  of heaven adorned with as many stars. The question, with the gawsy and generous gudewife of Mount Pleasant, was not \u2014 \"My dear laddie, which will ye hae \u2014 hinny or jam'!\" but, \" Which will ye hae first!\" The honey, we well remember, was in two huge brown jugs, or jars, or crocks; the jam, in half a dozen white cans of more moderate dimensions, from whose mouths a veil of thin transparent paper was withdrawn, while, like a steam of rich distilled perfumes, rose a fruity fragrance, that blended with the vernal balminess of the humming  Sycamore. There the bees, were all at work for next May-day, happy as ever bees were on Hybla itself; and gone now though be the aee of gold, happy as Arcadians were we, nor wanted our festal-day or pipe or song ; for to the breath of Harry Wilion, the young English boy, the flute gave forth tunes almost as liquid sweet as those that flowed from the lips of Mary Morrison herself, who alone, of all singers in hut or hall that ever drew tears, left nothing for the heart or the imagination to desire in any one of Scotland's ancient melodies.

How apt to the hand the stalk \u2014 to the mouth how apt the bowl ! Each guest drew closer to his breast the deep broth-plate of delft, rather more than full of curds, many millions times more dcliciously desirable even than blanc-mange, and then filled to overflowing with a blessed outpouring of creamy richness that tenaciously descended from an enormous jug. the peculiar expression of whose physiognomy, particularly  the nose, we will carry with us to the grave! The dairy at Mount Pleasant consisted  of twenty cows \u2014 almost all spring calvers, and of the Ayrshire breed \u2014 so you may guess what cream ! The spoon could not stand in it \u2014 it was not so thick as that \u2014 for that was too thick \u2014 but the spoon when placed upright in it, retained its perpendicularity  for a while, and then, when uncertain on \u25a0winch side to fall, was grasped by the hand of hungry schoolboy, and steered with its fresh and fragrant freight into a mouth already open in wonder.

The old people when we first knew them, we used to think somewhat apt to be surly \u2014 for they were Seceders \u2014 and owing to some unavoidable prejudices, which we were at no great pains to vanquish, we Manse- boys recognised something repulsive in that most respectable word.

Mount Pleasant was let to a relative,  and the Morrisons retired to a small house, with a garden, a few hundred yards from the kirk. Let him be strong as a giant, infirmities  often come on the hard-working man before  you can well call him old.
