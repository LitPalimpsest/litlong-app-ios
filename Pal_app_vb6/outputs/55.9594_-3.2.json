And this picture got itself hung up upon the walls of my mind, full of a roseate glow of happiness and deliverance instead of the black despair which had seemed to be closing round me. That winter we went to Edinburgh, where I got a droll little house in Fettes Row, down at the bottom of the hill, the lower floor and the basement with a front door, in truly Edinburgh style-for \"flats\" were -not known in England in those days. It was a very severe winter, 186o-6I, and it was severe on me too.    "},{"title":"The autobiography and letters of Mrs. M.O.W.

Isabel had heard that Cat had taken a flatmate when she moved into Fettes Row, but she knew nothing about her other than that she came from St Andrews  and that she played golf, which almost everyone in St Andrews  did. This information  had  come  from  Eddie,  who  had  met  Claudia when  she came into the delicatessen.    "}]
