Yes, vanished; for though there was an instantaneous shout and rush after him, by the time the crowd reached the bottom of the steep little street, they discovered that they were chasing\u2014nothing ! The fact was, that the thief, immediately after turning the corner, had cut into a stair leading up to the South Bridge, and at the same moment one or two professional thieves, thinking that he was one of themselves, took up the cry and led the halloo past the stair and down the street.

I heard the news some time before I saw him; but at last we met full in the face in the High Street, a little below Niddry Street. I gave him a nod as a feeler, and was instantly favoured with a look of deep unswerving hate, which gave me a good cue to his after proceedings.

The others are built against by the houses on either side, and are mostly used by those occupying the lower flats in Blair Street, Niddry Street, etc., as a kind of large store-rooms or great cellars. Now, as Maclusky's house could be entered either from Blair Street or the South Bridge, I knew that it could not be far from one of these arches.
