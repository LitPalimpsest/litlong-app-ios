Much of Scottish history has been made by the men who, from one generation to another, lived and died within that narrow limit ; and old George Dundas and Dame Katherine Oliphant little thought what an important part was to be played by the descendants of the younger son, for whom they thriftily saved money, and bought the Mains of Arniston.

They formed in one narrow column, keeping the high ground from Duddingston towards Musselburgh, where they crossed the Esk by the old bridge, and then advanced to the eminence of which Carberry hill is the termination to the south-west, near which, about Musselburgh or Inveresk, they expected to meet the enemy. On putting himself at the head of his army, the Prince drew his sword, and said to his followers, \" Gentlemen, I have flung away the scabbard,\" which was answered by shouts of acclamation.

When the Highlanders had advanced as far as Falside hill, near Carberry, their scouts brought in notice that they had seen parties of dragoons about Tranent, and it was reported that Sir John Cope was in that quarter with his whole army. The Chevalier's army, which had hitherto marched in one column, now divided into two, being their intended line of battle, and keeping towards the right, so as to preserve the upper ground, which was a great point in Highland tactics, marched onward with steadiness and celerity.

Up those outside stairs (from which the viragoes of the High Street insulted Mary Stuart, as she rode past them after her surrender at Carberry)\u2014up those ' fore-stairs,' as they are called, John Knox passed to his rooms; and from that little window at the corner he was wont to exhort the people. Just beneath it there is a rude figure of him preaching in a pulpit, and pointing with his right hand to a stone, on which is sculptured the rising sun, and the words, \u00a9EOS, Deijs, God.

I heard them talk anent the state the country was in, of Carberry, of the prisoning of the queen at Lochleven, and of the likelihood of a civil broil between the two factions, the queen's party and the congregation, yet albeit they talked of these things at some length, I neither heard them mention Morton or Maitland, so that when they were done and had gone out for their nags, and had ridden away, I was as wise anent the purpose they had in being abroad as I was at my coming in. Two careless, easy, deil-me care rascals they were I kend from their speech, as ready to sell their swords as their betters, but of more than that I was ignorant.

The confederated lords marched towards Dunbar, and the Queen and Bothwell, having assembled an army, advanced to the encounter, and met them on Carberry hill, not far from the place where the battle of Pinkie was fought.
