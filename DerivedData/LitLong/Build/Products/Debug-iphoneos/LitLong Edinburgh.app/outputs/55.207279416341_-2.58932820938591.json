At a small inn in Cumberland he falls in with Dandie Dinmont, a hospitable Scottish farmer just returning from the fairs. Their common interest in dogs and hunting leads Dinmont to invite Brown to stop at his farm, Charlies-hope, which lies close to the young man's pathway northward. The farmer starts out mounted on his horse Dumple, and is followed  by the captain afoot. On the road, Dinmont is set upon by ruffians, and escapes a severe beating only through the timely arrival of Brown and his dog Wasp. Then, both mounted upon Dumple, the two men proceed to Charlies- hope.]    "},{"title":"The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott.
