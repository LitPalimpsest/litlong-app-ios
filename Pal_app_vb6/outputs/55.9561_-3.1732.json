If the banker in Lombard street, on the contrary, emerges from the twilight of his counting-house to make a morning call on the wife of some foreign correspondent, lodging at the Clarendon, he steps into a Piccadilly omnibus, not in the salt-and-pepper creations of his Cheapside tailor, but (for he has an account with Stultz also for the west-end business) in a claret-colored frock of the last fashion at Crockford's, a fresh hat from New Bond street, and (if he is young) a pair of cherished boots from the Rue St. Honore.

At the foot of Regent-street there is Waterloo Place, spacious and grand ; magnificent clubhouses ; the Duke of York's monument, standing on the site of Carlton House, the favourite mansion of the last Prince of Wales ; Carlton Terrace, also magnificent ; Pall Mali ; the King's Theatre and Haymarket. Next, Trafalgar Square ; Charing Cross, looking down through Parliament-street to the Parliament Houses and Westminster Abbey ; the Strand; Temple Bar; and here for the present we rest, to introduce the stranger to London within the walls, and to a more particular description of this vast metropolis, in another place.
