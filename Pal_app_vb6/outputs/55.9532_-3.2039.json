Our house was immediately opposite to this one, divided by a very narrow street ; and I well remember, when watching his arrival on the day he took Pratique, hearing the sound of his voice as he chatted sociably to Mr. Greig (the inspector of quarantine), on whose arm he leaned while walking from the carriage to the door of his hotel \u2014 it seemed to me that I had hardly heard so home-like a sound in this strange land, or one that so took me back to Edinburgh and our own North Castle Street, where, in passing him as he walked up or down with a friend, I had heard it before so often. Nobody was at hand at the moment for me to show him to but an English maid, who, not having my Scotch interest in the matter, only said, when I tried to enlighten her as to the event of his arrival \u2014 \u2022 Poor old gentleman, how ill he looks.'

Nor must we omit to notice o the favourite dwelling of Sir Walter Scott, in North Castle Street,\u2014\" The dear thirtynine\" which he left under such mournful circumstances in 1826.
