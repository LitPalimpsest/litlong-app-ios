The first, part of a Dominican Convent founded, in 1224, is a lofty square structure, built upon, and supported by a pointed Gothic arch, and presenting, from its isolated position, a very striking object. Lawrence Gate is the only specimen remaining of the old fortifications of the town, and consists of two lofty round towers, with a low gateway between.

Many of the wearers of this costume have very plain persons, so that the general effect is by no means fascinating ! I now proceeded to the singular, antique Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, in a building adjoin ing which (once a rich Dominican Convent, now a barrack) is the celebrated fresco of the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci, unfortunately very much damaged by time, want of care, and other causes. I arrived just in time to be too late to see it, for in spite of my walking at a pace ill in character with the climate, it had become nearly dark.
