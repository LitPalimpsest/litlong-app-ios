Theestate of Glentanner came to us by the intermarriage of my ancestor withTib Sommeril, termed by the southrons Sommerville, a daughter of thatnoble house, but, I fear, on what my great-grandsire calls \"the wrongside of the blanket.\" [The ancient Norman family of the Sommervillescame into this island with William the Conqueror, and established onebranch in Gloucestershire, another in Scotland. After the lapse of sevenhundred years, the remaining possessions of these two branches wereunited in the person of the late Lord Sommerville, on the death of hisEnglish kinsman, the well-known author of \"The Chase.\"] Her husband,Gilbert, was killed fighting, as the INQUISITIO POST MORTEM has it, \"SUBVEXILLO REGIS, APUD PRAELIUM JUXTA BRANXTON, LIE FLODDDEN-FIELD.\"    "},{"title":"Miscellaneous Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart","author":"Scott, Walter","year":"1847-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003316905-01","placename":"The Chase","snippet":"The original source of the family was froma bold Baron of Somerville, in Normandy, whofollowed the banner of William the Conqueror tothe battle of Hastings. He was rewarded withample lands, the remnant of which, comprehendingSomerville-Aston, in Warwickshire, still consider-able, though much dilapidated and encumberedwith debt, descended to Somerville the poet, thefriend of Shenstone, and the author of The Chase,&c. A younger brother of the warrior of Hast-ings, and who had also fought in that memorablebattle, attended the court of Malcolm Canmore,bearing a falcon on his arm, and had the fortuneto become that Prince's Grand Falconer, and toobtain a grant of the lands of Linton, in Roxburgh-shire, for some gallant exploit, which traditionstates to have been the slaying of a huge serpent,appealing for the truth of the tale to a very ancientmonument, over a door of the parish church, onwhich there is certainly a beast engaged with anarmed knight, though the shape of the animal re-sembles a wolf, or bear, more than a snake. The Somervilles rose to eminence in Scotland,then sunk, and then again emerged into conse-quence ; so that Lord Somerville's immediate an-cestor, who retained a part of the ancient familypatrimony, was a man of considerable wealth.
