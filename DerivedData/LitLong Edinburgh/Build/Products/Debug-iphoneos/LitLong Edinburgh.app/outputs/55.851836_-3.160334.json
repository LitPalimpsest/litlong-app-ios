My brother is a man of unusual hospitality, who will be only too glad to welcome any friends of his sister ; and being a man of remarkable curiosity, he will be delighted with the novelty of meeting two American gentlemen with a wife and two children.\"    "},{"title":"A Tour in Tartan-Land","author":"Bede, Cuthbert","year":"1863-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-000247793","placename":"Roslin Castle","snippet":"THE origin of the building of Roslin Castle, like the authorship of the ballad of ' Roslin Castle,' is not known.
