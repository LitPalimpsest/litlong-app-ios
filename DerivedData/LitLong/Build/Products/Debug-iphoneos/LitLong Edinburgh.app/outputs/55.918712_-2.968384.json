Bishop Heber, who was so well able to judge of the attainments  of other men by the extent of his own, mentions Mount-Stuart Elphinstone in his delightful Indian Journal  as altogether the most accomplished man he had ever known. We saw him frequently after this, both in Edinburgh and London, and always with renewed pleasure.    "}]
