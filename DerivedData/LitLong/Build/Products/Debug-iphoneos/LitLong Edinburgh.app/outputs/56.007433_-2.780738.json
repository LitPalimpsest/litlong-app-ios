A hundred years ago, the houses thus marked were held as part of the barony of Drem in Haddingtonshire, the baron of which used to hold courts in them occasionally ; and here were harboured many persons not free of the city corporations, to the great annoyance  of the adherents of local monopoly. At length, the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1747 extinguished this little barony, but not certain other legal rights connected  with the Templar Lands, which, however, it might be more troublesome to explain than advantageous to know.
