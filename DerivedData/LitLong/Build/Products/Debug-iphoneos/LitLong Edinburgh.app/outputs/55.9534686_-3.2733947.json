To the south it adjoined another house, but standing in so large a garden as to be well out of cry; on all other sides, open fields stretched upward to the woods of Corstorphine Hill, or backward to the dells of Ravelston, or downward toward the valley of the Leith. The effect of seclusion was aided by the great height of the garden walls, which were, indeed,  conventual, and, as John had tested in former days, defied the climbing schoolboy.

There is something else which, likeSusanna Crum's name, is absolutely and ideally right! Stevenson calls itone of the most satisfactory crags in nature--a Bass rock upon dryland, rooted in a garden, shaken by passing trains, carrying a crownof battlements and turrets, and describing its warlike shadow over theliveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the new town.
