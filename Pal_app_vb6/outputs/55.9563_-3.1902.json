Willy, the sheep, pastured in the ground adjoining to the Excise Office, now the Royal Bank, and might be daily seen standing at the railings, watching Mr Wood's passing to or from his house in York Place, when Willy used to poke his head into his coat-pocket, which was always filled with supplies for his favourite, and would then trot along after him through the town, and sometimes might be found in the houses of the doctor's patients. The raven was domesticated at an ale and porter shop in North Castle Street, which is still, or very lately was, marked by a tree growing from the area against the wall.

They now raised their heads ; and grow ing in numbers, and in aristocracy, erected their new chapels at the west end of Princes Street, and at the east end of York Place.

The very name of York Place serves to preserve the notion they entertained, that the south side of that street was to be the extreme northern boundary of the extended royalty, looking out on an uninterrupted view towards the sea ; and to the same idea we are in some degree indebted for the Queen Street gardens, which now form so beautiful and valuable a feature of the New Town. It may be presumed, indeed, that the courageous adventurers who first began to build on these remote outskirts of modern civilization, as little dreamt of extending buildings interrupting their viyv, as an inhabitant of Brighton Parade, or the builder of a marine villa on the sands of Portobcllo, could anticipate sonic daring speculator rearing houses between him and the sea !
