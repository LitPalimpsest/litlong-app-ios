On the north bank is Inchmarlo (D. Davidson. Esq.) About a mile farther on is Woodend Cottage, peeping from a plantation sloping to the Dee. At the twenty-fourth mile from Aberdeen is the Brig of Potarch, where the old south and north road, still used by drovers, crosses to the Cairn o' Mont, Fettercairn,  and Brechin.    "}]
