The arms of the ancient burgh of Canongate continue to exhibit the hart ; the head, with its branchy horns, still flares in gold from the walls of the gray, time-worn tolbooth : and I find it stated by Mr Daniel Wilson, so well known for his antiquarian researches, that the ancient service-book which records the incident relates that it took place in the fourth year of the reign of David, when he was residing in the neighbouring fortress, then surrounded, it is added by the chronicler, \" with ane gret forrest, full of hartis, hynds, toddis, and sic like manner of bestis.\"    "},{"title":"His Dearest Wish.

Soon passing from betwixt the walls of rock that hemmed them in on either side, the two pedestrians stood within view of that beautiful sheet of water the Duddingston Loch. So still and calm was the night that scarce a ripple broke the glassy surface of the lake stretched out like a large extended sheet of crystal, in which the roman-    "},{"title":"James Nasmyth, Engineer: An Autobiography","author":"Nasmyth, James","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/476","placename":"Duddingston Loch","snippet":"As I have already said, there is no such scenery near any city that I know of.

Then the picture was so well framed-in\u2014by Braid and Blackford in their freshest green on the one hand, and by the lion-like Arthur's Seat, and the blue waters of Duddingston Loch, on the other, while before it rose the grey walls of Craigmillar Castle and Liberton Jock's Tower, both eloquent of the feuds and forays of olden time; a prim little village, with a picturesque enough church-tower\u2014like a rather grave and severe rustic beauty\u2014crowning the middle height.
