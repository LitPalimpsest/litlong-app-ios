She could read fluently, and as they had wandered down by Drummond Street to the Pleasance, she soon made out the sign of John Gilpie, licensed broker, and at once entered the shop and opened up her business. The hideous face of the miser frightened her, as it had often frightened those of older growth; but the thought of Billy nerved her on, and she managed to make her shaking hands undo the locket, and placed it in his hands with the words\u2014 \" If you please, sir, will you buy that ? \" \" Can't buy it from you\u2014not allowed to buy from children,\" he snarled, with a look that curdled her blood.

Now, it so happened, that just as the queer pair were passing the school at the corner, I was coming down the Pleasance, and though I did not recognise the priest, nor suspect that he was following the dog, I did recognise Peep, and instantly resolved to watch where he went. Both priest and dog turned up the narrow close, and, after a proper interval, I followed.

Accordingly he insisted on giving the cook his address in the Pleasance, and his name at the same time, entreating her to drop him a line if she should relent and decide to meet him. The cook scornfully refused the address, but the tablemaid took it down, and intimated with a look to M'Sweeny that she would make it all right for him with the cook.
