Do you not hear it !\" she cried back to him ; and they listened together, smiling because it was such fun to do anything together, to the risping, whistling sound of a wind-blown waterfall. \"It comes down peat-red,\" she told him gloatingly, and with an air of showing off a private treasure she led him to the grey fold in the hills where the Logan Burn tumbled down a spiral staircase of dark polished rock. She ran about the pools at its feet, crying that this wee one was red as rust, that this big one was red as a red rose was it not, if you looked in the very middle?

It would be good to lie down for the night on the heather of some ledge on the hillside where one could hear the Logan Burn talking as it ran from the fall, and to look up and see Mr. Yaverland sitting in that nice slouching way he had, a great black shape against the stars. But that was a daft idea.    "}]
