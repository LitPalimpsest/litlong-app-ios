Tradition at Dundas Castle charges her with having damaged the family estate to obtain an inheritance for her son, while at Arniston her name has been handed down as that of a prudent dame, who had provided for her son from the savings of her pin-money. Among other family relics there is still at Arniston a piece of tapestry, about seven feet long and three feet wide, in which the Oliphant arms, with the initials K. O., form the centre of the design, between two oval medallions, the upper one of which represents St. Paid pressing Timothy to take a glass of wine, and is encircled with the inscription, \" Paul saying to Temothe tak a lytl vyn to comfort stomort ;\" and the lower one a gentleman  bestowing a loaf upon a beggar, with the inscription, \" The Lord commandes the to break ye breade, and gyf yt ye hongrie.'

He was born in 1793, a  posthumous child, his father having perished in the wreck of the Winterton Indiaman, and , on coming of age, erected, at great cost, the modern Dundas Castle, a fine example of Tudor Gothic. He farmed, hunted, drove a four-in-hand from Dundas to Edinburgh, and was popular in the county, of which he was Vice-Lieutenant for many years.
