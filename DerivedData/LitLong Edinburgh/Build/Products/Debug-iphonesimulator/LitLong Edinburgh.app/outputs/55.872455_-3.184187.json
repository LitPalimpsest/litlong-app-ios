In his last kelp voyage he had been detained in this way from the close of August till the end of October ; and at length, deeply laden, he had threaded his way round Cape Wrath, and through the Pentland and across the Moray Firths, when a severe gale compelled him to seek shelter in the harbour of Peterhead. From that port, on the 9th of November 1807, he wrote my mother the last letter she ever received from him ; for on the day after he sailed from it there arose a terrible tempest, in which many seamen perished, and he and his crew were never more heard of.
