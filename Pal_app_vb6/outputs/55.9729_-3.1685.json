The chief gate of the town was St Anthony's Port, where the walls intersected the Kirkgate ; and beyond this point no vestige of them has remained since the middle of the sixteenth century, although they extended thence to the river, and were continued on the opposite side, so as to enclose the more modern suburb that formed the nucleus of North Leith.

They are represented in a perfect state, extending uninterruptedly from Bernard's Nook to the point of intersection at the Kirkgate, in a plan of Leith by Captain Greenville Collins, dedicated to Sir James Fleming, who was Provost of Edinburgh in 1681; and considerable remains of them were only cleared away in opening up Constitution Street and the neighbouring approaches, about thirty years since.
