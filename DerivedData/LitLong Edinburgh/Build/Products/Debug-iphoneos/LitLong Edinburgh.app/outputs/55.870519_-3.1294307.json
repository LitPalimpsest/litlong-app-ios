The Printer of the Canongate drove himself and his wife about the streets and suburbs in a snug machine, which did not overburthen one powerful and steady cob; \u2014 while the gay Auctioneer, whenever he left the saddle for the box, mounted a bright blue dog-cart, and rattled down the Newhaven road with two high-mettled steeds prancing tandem before him.

He now opened them in more fulness of detail, and explained his views in a manner that might well excite admiration, not unmixed with alarm.
