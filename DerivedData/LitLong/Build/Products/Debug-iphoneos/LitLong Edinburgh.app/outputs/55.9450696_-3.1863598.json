Some of these were not all that dissimilar to smells he had encountered before \u2013 mice, for instance, smelled roughly similar whether they infested the cellars and cupboards of the New Town or the gardens of South Edinburgh. That smell, at least, was familiar, but lawn seed was entirely new to Cyril, as was the smell that came off a bundle of green garden string, and the smell of a dead bat that had been trapped somewhere up in the shed's roof.

She had made her way back to the flat dreamily, hardly noticing where she was going and almost being run over as a result at the edge of the Meadows, the expanse of grass and trees that divided the Old Town, where she studied, from South Edinburgh, where she lived. She had been standing at the Dick Vet corner, looking up at the monstrously ugly building that the university had placed next to the comfortable old Veterinary College \u2013 a mistake from a period when such mistakes were made with impunity.

Matthew could not help the way he talked, which was in the accent of South Edinburgh, refined perhaps here and there as a result of his education at Watson's. If he did not sound as Scottish as Big Lou's braid Scots, then that showed that you should never judge a book by its cover, nor a person by his voice.
