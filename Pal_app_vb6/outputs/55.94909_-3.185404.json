[{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Cardinal Beaton's House","snippet":"Below this, at the corner of the Cowgate, formerly stood the English Episcopal Chapel, founded by Lord Chief Baron Smith in 1722. It was a plain edifice, possessing no external features of an ecclesiastical character, as may be seen in our engraving of \" Cardinal Beaton's House,\" where it appears on the further side of the wynd. The building existed exactly a century, having been demolished in 1822, after serving during that period as the place of worship of all loyal and devout Episcopal High Churchmen, at a time when Episcopacy and Jacobitism were nearly synonimous in Scotland.
