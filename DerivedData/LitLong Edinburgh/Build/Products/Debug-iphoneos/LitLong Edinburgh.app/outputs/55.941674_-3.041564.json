The stately mansion of Pinkie House, formerly the residence of the abbots of Dunfermline, still remains in perfect preservation, in the immediate vicinity of the scene where the fatal battle of Pinkie was fought. The Scots were at first victorious, and succeeded in driving back the enemy, and carrying off the royal standard of England; but being almost destitute of cavalry, they were unable to follow up their advantage, and being at length thrown into disorder by the enemy's men-atarms, consisting principally of a body of mounted Spanish carabineers in complete mail, they were driven from the field, after a dreadful slaughter, with the loss of many of their nobles and leaders, both slain and taken prisoners.
