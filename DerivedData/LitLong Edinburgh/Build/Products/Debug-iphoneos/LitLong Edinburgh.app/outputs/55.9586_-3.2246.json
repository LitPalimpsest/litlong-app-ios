This gentleman afterwards, viz., in 1800, held the office of Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and had the honour of being created Sir William Fettes, Baronet, of Comely Bank. He died in 1835, leaving the residue of his fortune to build and endow the large college in the vicinity of Inverleith Row which bears his name.    "},{"title":"Bonnie Hills o'Hame, and other gems.

They are situated on the north side of the city, with two suitable entrances, one from Inverleith Row and the other by the west gate, leading from the direction of Stockbridge, where the car wends along to the terminus at Comely Bank. The situation is an admirably chosen one for various reasons, as such an extensive place would be very difficult to secure fulfilling the necessary requirements.
