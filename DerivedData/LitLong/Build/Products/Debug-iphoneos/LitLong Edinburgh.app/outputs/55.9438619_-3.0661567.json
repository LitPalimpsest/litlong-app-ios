Beset by com- missionnaires, and hurried through the custom-house, where every facility was given, we felt very fortunate in escaping the notorious exactions of the Ship Inn, though our continental  curiosities were somewhat bruised. A gentleman from Rome, smuggling some beautiful shell eameos, dropped one in the struggle against time ; it was trodden under foot and smashed, but escaped the duty ! He paid four guineas on a roll of pictures, which were charged^ as some people value such things, by the square foot.    "}]
