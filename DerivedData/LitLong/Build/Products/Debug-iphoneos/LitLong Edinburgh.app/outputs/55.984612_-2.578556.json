We did not go into the town of Grantham, but passed close by it, leaving it on the right, and a little further came by a very good house of my Lord Tyrconnell's on our left called Belton, the seat of the Brownlows. There is a pretty avenue to it from the South, the trees it is planted with seem of different kinds and to have been planted at different times.
