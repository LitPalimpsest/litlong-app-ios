In one of these The Gander was engaged as a \"super.,\" and it was known to him that the treasurer was in the habit of leaving the theatre for his home, at the foot of Broughton Street, late every night, carrying under his arm or in his hand a tin box resembling a cash-box. This box contained nothing but metal checks, which the treasurer counted at his home.

This was not because there was more to eat \u2013 her breakfasts were always the same: a bowl of porridge, made from the cut-oats she obtained from the real-food shop in Broughton Street; and two slices of toast, one spread thinly with Marmite and one with marmalade. This breakfast never varied, at least when she was at home, and it was accompanied by whatever reading was current at the time \u2013 Mankind Quarterly, with its earnest anthropological papers, rubbed shoulders with the toast as easily as did the daily newspaper or an interesting letter set aside for leisurely perusal.

He made his way by Broughton Street to Greenside, where he entered a favourite public-house.
