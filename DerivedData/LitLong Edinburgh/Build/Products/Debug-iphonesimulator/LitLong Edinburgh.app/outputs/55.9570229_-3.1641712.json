This southern ridge continues steadily east as High Street till it has passed beautiful St. Giles, has given sites for the old-time houses of the aristocracy \u2014 now dingy enough and given over to tenements for the poor \u2014 and for the opening of sundry \"winds,\" narrow streets winding down to a lower level \u2014 and \"closes,\" short streets without a thoroughfare; then, about the time it passes the old John Knox house with balcony and outside stair, it becomes Canongate, fronted by mansions that were, and Canongate and Tolbooth, and then it flattens quite out into the plain where stands old Holyrood Palace and the ruined aisles of Holyrood Abbey Church. But just here, where you think that grandeur has given way to beauty, you see beyond this foreground a noble sweep of precipitous rocks known as Salisbury Craigs, and behind them, partly embraced by them, the bold bare mountain of Arthur's Seat.
