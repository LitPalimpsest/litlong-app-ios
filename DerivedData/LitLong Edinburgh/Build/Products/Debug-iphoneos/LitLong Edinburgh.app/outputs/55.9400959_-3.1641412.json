Gradually the wide sweep of green turf grew narrower and narrower, till there rose up, in massive grandeur\u2014 hewn out, as it were, by Nature's hand\u2014a mighty range of basaltic columns of rock, some groups upright, and commonly known by the name of Samson's Ribs; others lying horizontally, and presenting their ends to the spectator; whilst the lofty summit of Arthur's Seat, at a dizzy height above, looked down like some huge lion couchant, his broad back cut sharp and decided against the sky, watching for his prey in the still, sleeping landscape beneath. Soon passing from betwixt the walls of rock that hemmed them in on either side, the two pedestrians stood within view of that beautiful sheet of water the Duddingston Loch.

In the overhanging precipice to the south we are presented, in what is known as Samson's Ribs, with one of the finest specimens of basaltic columns on the east coast of Scotland, and of which the general aspect has been made widely known by the print given in the section devoted to volcanoes, in the great Physical Atlas, edited by Mr Alexander Keith Johnston of this city, a work of more than European reputation, which reflects honour on the science of Scotland. I need refer to but a few of the other names associated with the singularly instructive phenomena of this trappean group of hills, to that of an accomplished mineralogist, the late Mr Thomas Allan of Edinburgh, to that of the late Mr Hay Cunningham, and to those of Mr Town son, Mr Milne Home, Dr Fleming, and Professor Jamieson.

Nay, we might say that though a doubt on the subject had by any means got into her mind, it would not have remained there lunger than it took a shudder to scare the wild thing away.
