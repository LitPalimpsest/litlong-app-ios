Instead of proceeding from Shin Bridge right on to Rosehall, a detour may be made by Lairg (11 mOes from Bonar Bridge), which is very pleasingly situated at the lower end of Loch Shin. This loch is about 20 miles in length, and of a very softened character ; while the new churches and manses, Estabhslied and I'ree, and some scattered cottages, are featui-es quite in keeping with the scene.
