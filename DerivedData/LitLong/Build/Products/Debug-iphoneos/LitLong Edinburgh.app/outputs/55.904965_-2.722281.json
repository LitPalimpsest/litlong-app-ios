There was \" Ah for the change 'twixt now and then ! \" an institution  in Biggar as peculiar to it as is the Godiva procession  to Coventry, the \" Hurley-hacket ! \" It has ceased forever, because its possibility is no more. Forty years ago, the Corse Knowe, or Cross Hill, was as essential a feature in Biggar as St. Paul's in London, St. Rcgulus' Tower at St. Andrews, the Campanile in Venice, or our own Castle here. Biggar is no more Biggar as it was than the Apollo would be himself without his nose.    "}]
