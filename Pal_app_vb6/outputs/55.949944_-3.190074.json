Mr. Crosbie, for the greater part of his life, lived in a house at the foot of Allan's Close, lately in the possession of a Mr. Richard Cleghoin, a solicitor. From this place he was accustomed to walk every morning to the Parliament-house, dressed in his gown and wig; there being at that time no functionaries about the court, to dress in due these habiliments, as are employed at the present more punctilious times.
