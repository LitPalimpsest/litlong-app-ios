Tom and I had entered Edinburgh, after twenty miles of walking, between two and three p.m., got a clean-looking, most cheap lodging (Simon Square the poor locality), had got ourselves brushed, some morsel of dinner doubtless, and Palinurus Tom sallied out into the streets with me to show the novice mind a little of Edinburgh before sundown. The novice mind was not excessively astonished all at once, but kept his eyes well open, and said nothing.

Carlyle's first Edinburgh lodging, humble and very cheap, was in Simon Square \u2014 a dingy little street, then as now full of dingy and forlorn houses.

Further south, on the same side of the street, a small and mean-looking court, surrounded by humble tenements, and crowded with a dense population, bears the name of Simon Square. It has nothing in its appearance to attract either the artist or the antiquary, yet its associations are intimately connected with the Fine Arts; for here, in a narrow lane, called Paul Street, which leads thence into the Pleasance, David Wilkie took up his abode on his arrival in Edinburgh in 1799.

As was usual at that hour at the Surgeon's Hall, we met Freddy Esquillant coming from the direction of Simon Square. Him I sent off as quickly as he could to Rankeillor Street for Amelia Craven.
