Leaning at their feet, from the Siccar Point to Gifford, and from Gifford to Fala, besides abutting on the sea in insulated patches, as at North Berwick, Canty Bay, Tantallan, Seacliif, and Belhaven, we would next see, spread over a large space in the scene, the deep chocolate tint assigned, not unappropriately, to the Old Red. From Cock- burnspath to Dunbar on the one hand, and from Aberlady Bay to Arthur Seat on the other, the landscape would exhibit the cold gray hue of the Coal Measures, here and there mottled with the light azure that distinguishes in the map the Carboniferous Limestone ; while the trap eminences, with the tuff of the opposite shore, and the island mass at our feet, would flame in the deep crimson of the geologic colourist, as if the igneous rocks of which they are composed still retained the red heat of their molten condition.
