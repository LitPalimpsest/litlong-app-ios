The large ancient church of the Castle, as well as St Margaret's Chapel, form prominent objects in the Castle ; while in the town the Netherbow Port, the old High School, demolished in 1777, and others of the ancient features of the city are introduced with considerable care and accuracy of detail. The whole is engraved with great spirit, but no draftsman's or engraver's name is attached to it.
