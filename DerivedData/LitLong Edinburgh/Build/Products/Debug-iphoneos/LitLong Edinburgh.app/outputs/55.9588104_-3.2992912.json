The road in front led up to Edinburgh and down to the Firth of Forth, and crossing this westward was the picturesque road to Queensferry, passing by the Corstorphine Hills, Barnton, Dalmeny Park, and on to Hopetoun House. William and I have thus been close neighbours and friends from the time of his retirement, and we have also had constant intercourse with the Edinburgh section of the family, - Isabella, Marion and her family, Eliza and her lively and intellectual husband, Professor Blackie, and with our sister Augusta, George, Edward, and Janet having their occupations and residences in London.

Dundas Street itself was reasonably busy, but for some reason many of the people in the street had things other than coffee on their minds, and this left Big Lou the time to do her cleaning.

At the foot of the wynd was Mr Peter Ramsay's famed establishment, from which he retired with an ample fortune, and withdrew to his estate of Barnton, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, still possessed by his descendants. A large and handsome edifice, with considerable pretensions to architectural ornament, near the foot of the Pleasance, was the Black BulHnn, another of these commodious and fashionable establishments, which the erection of the North and South Bridges ruined, by diverting the current of visitors to the capital into a new channel.
