Carphin; there was Mr Henderson, of the British Linen Bank, a big, stout man with a tree leg; there was old Mr Noble, a most worthy, godly man, who sometimes came to our house, and liked a glass of port uncommonly, but he never partook of it without first asking a blessing on it and on the household; there was a Mr Menteith, a partner of the Glasgow house of Menteith & Co., famous as Turkey red dyers. After he had entered the business, he was led to be earnest in his piety, and became a student for the ministry; and while attending the Hall in Edinburgh, he acted as an elder with us.
