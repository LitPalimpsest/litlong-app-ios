Old Judith Butler, who had hobbled that evening as far as Woodend,  in order to enjoy the congratulations of her neighbors upon Reuben's return, and upon his high attainments, of which she was herself not a little proud, was somewhat mortified  to find that her old friend Deans did not enter into the subject with the warmth she expected.
