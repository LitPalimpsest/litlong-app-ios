Mr. Digges was certainly the most polite gentleman in the world to his ladies, and not choosing to have Mrs. Digges's name in the bills, (for living together in Scotland constitutes a marriage while in that kingdom) he most graciously exchanged his name of Digges for Bellamy; also, let that lady perform whatever character she would, she was always placed at the head of the bill; as for instance:\u2014This day Romeo and Juliet: Juliet, Mrs. Bellamy; Romeo, Mr. Bellamy.\u2014On being introduced into the green  oom I met with little neat Mrs. Mozeen, my Portsmouth Desdemona, 1758, who by the name of Edwards had been bred carefully up, and introduced    "},{"title":"Black's picturesque tourist of Scotland.","author":null,"year":"1857-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t9862nx30","placename":"Bonnington","snippet":"The extent of its drainage, exclusive of the Leven, is 945 square miles.
