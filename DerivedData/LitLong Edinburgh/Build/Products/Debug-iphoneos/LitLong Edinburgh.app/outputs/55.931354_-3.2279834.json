The lady of the house, who secretly favoured the Presbyterian interest, connected the appearance of this party, and the inquiries which they made concerning the road to Polwarth castle, with some danger threatened to Sir Patrick Hume. She dared not write to apprize him, and still less durst she trust a messenger with any verbal communication.

Halyburton's message to Lady Home of Polwarth was a brief one, for when she opened his envelope there was nothing there to read--only a little feather fluttered out, giving as plainly the advice to instant flight as pages of words might have done.

On the discovery of the Rye House Plot, Baillie of Jerviswoode and Home of Polwarth, innocent men both, were denounced as traitors to their King. Baillie was taken, and after several months of imprisonment in London, so heavily loaded with chains that his health completely broke down, he was brought by sea to Edinburgh in stormy November weather which kept the ship a fortnight on its way.

A black walnut folding-bed, exactly underneath the pulpit from which the minister of Polwarth preached every Sunday, was the fugitive's resting-place at night, while for a month he saw no more daylight than was able to reach him from a slit at one end of the vault. The ashes of his ancestors were scarcely lively company, but Sir Patrick found \"great comfort and constant entertainment\" by repeating to himself Buchanan's Latin Version of the Psalms.

If we have been loyal to the brave Douglas, Douglas was ever loyal to Scotland, and, methinks, if jealous tongues had not poisoned the ear of our king, and placed him by their venom to brood behind prison walls, the king's advisers would never have dared urge their royal youthful master to strike such a blow against his Border subjects.
