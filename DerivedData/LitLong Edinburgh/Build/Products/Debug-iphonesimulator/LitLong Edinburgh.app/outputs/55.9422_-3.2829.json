She could not go to the Boreland or be seen on the Glebe Road, she could not examine the spot where as the spring night drew to morning Sandy Ewan had gripped his last handful of earth and weeds. Nor yet to the Great House of Lowran, guarded by Jonathan Grier, and inhabited by two women who hated her.    "},{"title":"Strong Mac,","author":"Crockett, S.

In the struggle on the Glebe Road, it was Sandy Ewan who had been the aggressor Sandy Ewan who, first in his insensate fury, had trampled all likeness of humanity out of his poacher accomplice.
