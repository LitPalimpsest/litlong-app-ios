From many points in the moss you may see at one glance its whole course and that of all its tributaries ; the geographer of this Lilliput may visit all its corners without sitting down, and not yet begin to be breathed ; Shearer's Knowe and Halkerside are but names of adjacent cantons on a single shoulder of a hill, as names are squandered (it would seem to the inexpert, in superfluity) upon these upland shcepwalks ; a bucket would receive the whole discharge of the toy    "}]
