When he returned home and found his wife a maniac, and his house in the possession of another, it so inflamed his rage, that he swore nothing would extinguish the fire but the heart's blood of the regent; thus giving up his whole soul to revenge, he followed him from place to place, watching an opportunity to strike the bl ow : when hearing that the regent was to pass through Linlithgow on his way to Edinburgh, he took his stand at a window, waiting his approach. Murray had got a hint of his danger, and resolved to ride quickly through the city ; but just as he came opposite the fatal spot, a pressure in the crowd for a moment impeded his course, when the assassin found time to take so sure an aim, that he shot the regent with a single bullet.

From nearly the spot where, towards the end of the thirteenth century, the English army triumphed over the devoted Scots, did the royal army of England, about the middle of the eighteenth century, attack a handful of Highlanders ; but with very different fortune ; for no sooner had these daring sons of the mountains charged the veteran troops of the Elector of Hanover, than a general rout ensued : the royal army, panick struck, fled as far as Linlithgow, where they set fire to the palace, and did other mischief in their precipitate retreat. The Highlanders, negleding to reap the advantage which so decisive a stroke had put in their power, gave over the pursuit ; and, while loitering in the town of Falkirk, an unfortunate accident which took place at this critical jundure greatly conduced to throw a damp on the success of the arms of the unfortunate Charles Stuart.
