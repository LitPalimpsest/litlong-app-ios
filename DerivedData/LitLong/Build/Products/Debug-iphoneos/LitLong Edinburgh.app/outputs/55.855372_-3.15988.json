It was on Easter Tuesday, April 22, 1862, that RoslinChapel, furnished with proper fittings,* was opened forthe service of the Scottish Episcopal Church, for thebenefit of the Episcopalian residents of the district.

At the end of ten minutes or a quarter of anhour you emerge from the suite of rooms, which are asinteresting and wonderful as any of the romances oftheir gifted creator; and you endeavour, it may be,to arrange your reminiscences, and to question yourselfas to what you have seen in those brief minutes.
