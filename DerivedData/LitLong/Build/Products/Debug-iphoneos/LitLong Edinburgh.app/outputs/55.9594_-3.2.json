And this picture got itself hung up upon thewalls of my mind, full of a roseate glow of happiness anddeliverance instead of the black despair which had seemedto be closing round me. That winter we went to Edinburgh, where I got adroll little house in Fettes Row, down at the bottomof the hill, the lower floor and the basement with afront door, in truly Edinburgh style-for \"flats\" were-not known in England in those days. It was a verysevere winter, 186o-6I, and it was severe on me too.    "},{"title":"The autobiography and letters of Mrs. M.O.W.
