He refers to his book The Jewel: \"Laying aside all other businesses\", he says, \"and cooping myself up daily for some hours together, betwixt the case and the printing-press, I usually afforded the setter copy at the rate of above a whole printed sheet in the day; which, although by reason of the smallness of a Pica letter, and close couching thereof, it did amount to three full sheets of my writing; the aforesaid setter, nevertheless (so nimble a workman he was), could in the space of twenty-four hours make dispatch  of the whole, and be ready for another sheet. He and I striving thus who should compose fastest, he with his hand and I with my brain; and his uncasing of the letters and placing them in the composing instrument, standing for my conception; and his plenishing of the gaily and imposing of the form, encountering with the supposed equi-value of my writing, we would almost every foot or so jump together in this joint expedition, and so nearly overtake other in our intended course, that I was oftentimes (to keep him doing) glad to tear off parcels of ten or twelve lines apiece, and give him them, till more were ready; unto which he would so suddenly put an order that almost still, before the ink of the written letters were dry, their representatives were (out of their respective boxes) ranked in the composing-stick; by means of which great haste, I writing but upon the loose sheets of card-    "},{"title":"Scottish eccentrics","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/81908351","placename":"The Jewel","snippet":"Unfortunately his testamentary disposition  was set aside by the law courts and so the serried battalions of McCaigs in stone with which he designed to gratify the eyes of posterity to the end of time have not materialised.
