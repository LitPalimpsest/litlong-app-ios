Bridges had a good taste for pictures.  He hada small but choice collection by the Old Masters, which he keptarranged in the warehouse under his shop.  He took great pride inexhibiting them to his visitors, and expatiating upon their excellence.I remember being present in his warehouse with my father when a verybeautiful small picture by Richard Wilson was under review.  Davieburst out emphatically with, \"Eh, man, did ye ever see such gloriousbuttery touches as on these clouds!\"  His joking friends clubbed him\"Director-General of the Fine Arts for Scotland,\" a title which hecomplacently accepted.  Besides showing off his pictures, Davie was anart critic, and wrote articles for the newspapers and magazines.Unfortunately, however, his attention to pictures prevented him fromattending to his shop, and his customers (who were not artists) forsookhim, and bought their clothes elsewhere.  He accordingly shut up hisshop, and devoted himself to art criticism, in which, for a time, hepossessed a monopoly. ...]    "},{"title":"Over-Sea; or, England, France and Scotland as seen by a live American ...
