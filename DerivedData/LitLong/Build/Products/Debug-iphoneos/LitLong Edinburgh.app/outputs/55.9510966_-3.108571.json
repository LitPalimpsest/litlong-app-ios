[{"title":"Miscellaneous Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bart","author":"Scott, Walter","year":"1847-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003316905-01","placename":"Saint Mark'S","snippet":"It may be observed, however, that he seldom seems to have struck out an original path forhimself, but rather wrote because others had written successfully, and in the manner of which theyhad set an example, than from the strong impulseof that inward fire, which makes or forces a wayfor its own coruscations, without respect to thecourse of others. Thus Cumberland wrote anElegy in a Churchyard on Saint Mark's Eve, because Gray had, with general applause, publishedan Elegy in a Country Churchyard. He composeda drama on the subject of Elfrida, and with a chorus, in imitation of Mason ; he imitated Hammond, and he imitated Spenser, and seems to display a mind full of information and activity, abounding with the natural desire of distinction, but whichhad not yet attained sufficient confidence in itsown resources, to attempt a road to eminence ofhis own discovery ; and this is a defect from whichnone of his compositions are perhaps entirely free.
