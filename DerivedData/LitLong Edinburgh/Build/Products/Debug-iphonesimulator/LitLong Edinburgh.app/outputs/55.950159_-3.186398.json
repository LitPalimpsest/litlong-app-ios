Crichton, Lord High Chancellor of Scotland.2 Directly opposite to the site of this is another ecclesiastical edifice, the mansion of the Abbot of Melrose, which enters from Strichen's Close. It is a large and substantial stone building, enclosing a small square or court in the centre, the original access to which seems to have disappeared.
