This purpose also failing, Nicol Muschat, or Muschet, did finally, on the 17th October, 1720, carry his wife under cloud of night to the King's Park, adjacent to what is called the Duke's Walk, near Holyrood Palace, and there took her life by cutting her throat almost quite through, and inflicting other wounds. He pleaded guilty to the indictment, for which he suffered death.    "},{"title":"Autobiography of the Rev.

Though public gardens as yet were not, the old city gates opened abruptly upon country suburbs and country fields pressing close to its walls; and its private gardens were so extensive and so generally appreciated that they were allowed to become in a measure the people's property, so that my Lady Murray's garden was as well-favoured an assignation as the King's Park or the Duke's Walk.

Nor did he lose time in getting up, and even as far as the north base of the Lion's head\u2014giving, in the meantime, his instructions to Shagg, who was far better pleased in doing his duty among the sheep than in philosophizing over these midnight scenes.

They also had their walks on the Castle Hill, and the pier of Leith, and in the King's Park, or along the Duke's Walk; they too had their junketings, and their suppers sometimes aider the patronage of the reigning quality; and proud women they were when it was so, though they lay in bed half the next day, racked with headaches and sick with vexation because some lord, or lady, or squire's daughter, had forgotten them, slighted them, or discountenanced them.

He even found a slight relief in the muscular exertion, and thus hurrying on, he reached the Duke's Walk, and came to the heap of stones called Muschet's Cairn, from Nichol Muschet of Boghall, who there murdered his wife. With no object but movement to dispel his misery, it was indifferent to him whither he should go ; and hurrying to Arthur' s Seat, he began to climb the hill, regardless of the dangerous characters often encountered there at night, any one of whom he had courage enough to have throttled at the moment he was flying from what was little more than a mere phantom.

Hence, according to the report of the family, the way his Royal Highness took came to be called The Duke's Walk ; afterwards a famous resort for the lighting of duels. Sir James became Catholic, and, while provost in 1681, had his house burned over his head by the collegianers ; but it was rebuilt, as it now stands, at the public expense.
