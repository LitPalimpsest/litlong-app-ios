S. Lockhart, Esq.), a modern mansion, ornamented  with pinnacles and tabernacle work, and seated on a lawn, shaded by lime and chestnut trees. This district, which has earned the name of \" The Orchard of Scotland,\" or '\u2022 The Fruit Lands,\" presents \" one uninterrupted series of grove, garden, and orchard \u2014 a billowy ocean of foliage, waving in the summer wind, and glowing under the summer sun.\" Nearly six miles from Hamilton, the Edinburgh road to Ayr crosses the Clyde at Garrion Bridge, which derives its name from a seat of Lord Belhaven's, in the immediate vicinity, and a short way on is the village of Dalserf, celebrated for its orchards.
