Can any of the learned professorstell us ? The ancient Irish explained it all, without theleast difficulty. The Causeway, they said, was builtby the Giants, under their Chief, Fion Mac Coul, therenowned Fingal, father of Ossian. This is cuttingthe knot, which an Irishman always knows how todo, when he cannot untie it; and here, for aught Ican see, the question must rest for the present.

They are said by geologists to have been formed by the cooling of the molten material of which they are composed, the fusion being due to volcanic action.
