This name of Jamaica Street, and also that ofVirginia Street, may have suggested to our minds thatthere had been, at some time or other, an intimateacquaintance between Glasgow and tobacco. GlassfordStreet, too\u2014whose name, as strangers, we might belikely to overlook\u2014would also help us to the same information ; for Mr. Glassford was one of those tobaccomerchants who, a century ago, lorded it among thearistocracy of Glasgow, stalking through the streetsin gay scarlet cloaks, like to that which Frank Osbaldistone wore when he fought Rashleigh in the CollegeGarden, hard by the Saltmarket.

I have before indicated that the shipping trade of Glasgowis a heavy one; but even more than this may be said of itsChannel traffic, which seems to include steamers, whethertrading-packets or excursion boats, to nearly every one ofthe western Channel ports, to the Isle of Man, to Ireland, tothe Scottish Islands, to France, with one prosperous line, ofwhich I saw some of the betokening flags and funnels thatday, between that port and the Empire City of the WesternWorld.

As 1 might have anticipated, I found the scene at the Jamaica Street bridge which the elevation of its roadway enabled me to reach one of wider desolation, but far more awful grandeur, than the circumscribed one I had left. Placed on its centre arch, and looking upward, it seemed as if some mighty transatlantic stream, and not an island river, rolled along in terrible depth and irresistible might, between banks whose edges were steep and abrupt indeed, for, defined only by the fronts of the far-separated lines of houses that stood many hundred feet distant from its usual channel, but close beside which it now rushed furiously by in boiling eddies of clay-coloured waves, fearful in their silent, unfoamy turbulence, which no wind stirred up as is the angry malice of a man, for whose fury we perceive no present  cause.
