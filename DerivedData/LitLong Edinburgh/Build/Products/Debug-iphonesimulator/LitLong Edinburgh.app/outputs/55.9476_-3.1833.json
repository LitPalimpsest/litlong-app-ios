Its position, however, is farther to the east than the house is shown to have stood ; and Malcolm Laing supposes it to have been a gun-port, connected with a projecting tower, which formerly existed directly opposite Roxburgh Street; but its appearance and position are much more those of a door-way, and no port-hole resembling it occurs in any other part of the wall. In a drawing of the locality at the time of the murder, preserved in the State Paper Office, (a sac simile of which is engraved in Chalmers's Life of Queen Mary,) the ruins of the Provost's house seem to extend nearly to the projecting tower, so that the tradition is not without some appearance of probability.

With this army he marched to an open space of ground now covered by Adam Street, Roxburgh Street, &c. named in former times Thomson's Park, where, mounted upon the shoulders of six of his lieutenant-generals, he proceeded to harangue them, in Cambyses' vein, concerning the flagrant oppression which they were about to revenge. He concluded by directing his men to sack the premises of the cruel landlord, who by this time had wisely made his escape ; and this order was instantly obeyed.    "}]
