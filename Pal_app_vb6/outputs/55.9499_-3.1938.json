It was found that the main beams of the house, of fine old oak, were continued forward through the stone wall, so as to support the wood work beyond, and this was further confirmed by the existence of a large fireplace on the outside of the stone wall; an arrangement which may still be seen in a similarly constructed land at the head of Lady Stair's Close, and probably in others. Within this house there was one of the beautifully sculptured gothic niches, already alluded to, of which we furnish a view, in the state in which it existed when the house was taken down.

The first of these was surmounted with stone gables of unequal size, somewhat in the style of \" Gladstone's land,\" at the head of Lady Stair's Close, and apparently built not later than the reign of Charles I. The other building, which presented its main front down the High Street, though evidently a more recent erection, yielded in interest to none of the private buildings of Edinburgh.

The land is an ancient and very substantial building, with large and neatly moulded windows, retaining the marks of having been finished with stone mullions; in one tier in particular the windows are placed one above another, only separated at each story by a narrow lintel, so as to present the singular appearance of one long and narrow window from top to bottom of the lofty land.
