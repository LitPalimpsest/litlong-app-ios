(vol. i. p. 141). Very likely he had gone back to Simon Square, for he speaks (p. 152), of being out in Nicolson Street for his walk 'one blessed Sunday morning, perhaps 7 or 8 A. M., in the ' fierce Radical and antiRadical  times,' when he met ' the Lothian Yeomanry, Mid or East I know not, getting under way for Glasgow,' and no doubt joined in the contemptuous shout which ' rose from the crowd by way of farewell cheer,' saying, as plain as words, ' may the devil go with you, ye peculiarly contemptible and dead to the distresses of your fellow-creatures. ' It was at the door of ' Peddie's Meeting House, a large, fine place behind Bristo Street,' that the strangely and suddenly pathetic farewell took place (p. 109) between Carlyle and his former landlady in Annan.

Carlyle's companion was 'one Tom Small, who had already been to College last year.' ' Tom and I,' he says (vol. ii. p. 4), ' had entered Edinburgh, after twenty miles of walking, between two and three P.M., got a clean-looking most cheap lodging (Simon Square \u2014 the poor locality), had got ourselves brushed, some morsel of dinner perhaps, and Palinurus Tom sallied out into the street with me to show the novice mind a little of Edinburgh before sundown.' Then follows the wonderfully vivid description of the hall of the Parliament House, and the impression which it made on the ' novice mind.'

In 1822, when he had become tutor to Charles BuUer and his younger brother, Carlyle says, ' I still lodged in my old rural rooms, 3 Moray Place, Pilrig Street,' showing he had some time left Simon Square, or other like lodging. He should have written Moray Street, not Place; it is a small street opening off Pilrig Street, and runs parallel to Leith Walk.

An unexpected doorway gave outward as his weight came on it, and he found himself in a curious court somewhere at the back of St Simon Square, as near as he could make out. There was a strange square block towards one side of the open space, round which he ran ; and, climbing up a convenient roan or water pipe, he squirmed himself through a stair window, crossed the landing of an uninhabited house, and looked down on the interior of a court which was well known to him, from the safe elevation of a first floor window.
