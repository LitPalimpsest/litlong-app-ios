What is done at first is done of impulse, nor can we imagine how a more powerful or a more general impulse will be given, and so as to extend far beyond the religious public of Scotland, than by a movement, if it shall be made, of hundreds of our most honoured clergymen, who, in obedience to the high behests of a great and a sacred principle, resolve to cast themselves on the care of Providence, and on such an instrumentality as Providence might be pleased to raise for the maintenance of a Free Church and an incorrupt Gospel in these lands. We have no fear that there will be a very fresh and vigorous impulse at the first, but a thing of mere impulse is destined to subside, and care must be taken that what is a thing of impulse at the first shall be so sustained and so operated upon as to become a tiling of habit afterwards.

And then Hill recreated the scene in a painting, using the calotypes as the models for the people in it.

And yet the work of church-building was far from finished ; for, contrary to all anticipations, the people had forsaken the Establishment in a much higher ratio, as to numbers, than the ministers ; and it would have required more than 700 churches to accommodate the congregations who were ready to attach themselves to the Free Church. To meet the spiritual wants of more than 200 unprovided congregations,  the Church had only ISO licentiates at command, some of whom, it might be presumed, were unlikely to be elected as ministers.

When these anticipations were falsified, and it became evident that the Free Church was to rank among the permanent institutions of the country, many of these hostile proprietors gave way, but a goodly number still stood out. Having waited patiently, but in vain, for two years, in the hope that this spirit of intolerance would spontaneously subside, and having exhausted all means of private influence and remonstrance,  the General Assembly of 1845 petitioned Parliament  and the Legislature, stating the grievance, and praying for legislative redress.

To meet all the temporary necessities of her position, it was proper and needful that the Free Church should avail herself of them to the uttermost.
