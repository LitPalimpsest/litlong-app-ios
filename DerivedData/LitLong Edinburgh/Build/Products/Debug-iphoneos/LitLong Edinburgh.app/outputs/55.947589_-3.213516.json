The street for which we  were now bound took its rise among blowing sands,  somewhere in view of the Lone Mountain Cemetery; ran  for a term across that rather windy Olympus of Nob  Hill, or perhaps just skirted its frontier; passed  almost immediately after through a stage of little  houses, rather impudently painted, and offering to the  eye of the observer this diagnostic peculiarity, that  the huge brass plates upon the small and highly-coloured  doors bore only the first names of ladies\u2014  Norah or Lily or Florence; traversed China Town, where  it was doubtless undermined with opium cellars, and its  blocks pierced, after the similitude of rabbit-warrens,  with a hundred doors and passages and galleries;  enjoyed a glimpse of high publicity at the corner of  Kearney; and proceeded, among dives and warehouses,  towards the City Front and the region of the water-rats. In this last stage of its career, where it was  both grimy and solitary, and alternately quiet and  roaring to the wheels of drays, we found a certain  house of some pretension to neatness, and furnished  with a rustic outside stair.
