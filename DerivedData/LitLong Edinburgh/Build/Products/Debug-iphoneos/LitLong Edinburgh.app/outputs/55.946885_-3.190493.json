It was undertaken by request of the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, and delivered to its members and a large circle of guests in December ; the special subject being, ' The Industrial Museum of Scotland in its relation to Commercial Enterprise\/ Through the liberality of Mr. James Eichardson, Master of the Company, it was printed and distributed widely throughout the country, and was the means of securing valuable specimens.

In the spring of 1855, the Independent Chapel in Argyle Square which Dr. Wilson had attended as a place of worship for the previous ten years and the hospital adjoining, were secured, and in them stores of specimens quickly began to accumulate.
