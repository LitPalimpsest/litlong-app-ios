It did not, however,succeed; but, upon being renewed, some years after-wards, sufficient funds were raised to enable the pro-fessors to open a small house for a few patients, and thesubscriptions still increasing, a charter was granted, foran act of incorporation, by George the Second, and thefoundation laid, in 1738, of the Royal Infirmary. Fromthat period, to the present, an intimate connection hassubsisted between the institution and the University\u2014beneficial to both.    "},{"title":"Rambles in Europe in 1839.

He was neverdistinguished, however, as a teacher in that branch\u2014being deficient in voice and manner, and had acquiredso inveterate a habit of hemming, snuffling, hesitating,and recalling words, as to render his lectures very unpalatable to most of his hearers. Age, I found, had notcorrected but increased these defects; and, as he neverenjoyed private practice, to any extent, and, indeed,seemed to have no turn for it, but depended, altogether,for his experience, on a month or two of clinical attendance, annually, upon a few patients in the Royal Infirmary, I presume his lectures on the Practice of Physiccannot be very edifying to his pupils. He is, however, aman of fine education, extensive general information, solidprofessional acquirements, and, I believe, of most amiable feelings, and respectable character.
