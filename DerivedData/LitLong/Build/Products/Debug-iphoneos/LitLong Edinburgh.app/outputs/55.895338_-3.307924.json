Mr, Keble came as one of the Oxford Examiners  of the school that summer to the Arnolds, and my daughters had the gratification of meeting him at the School House, as they remained a few weeks at Bilton after I left it. We still retained the cottage for the year we had taken it, although our family plans had been changed by Mrs. Taylor having decided to rejoin her husband, then employed in Ireland ; her son was therefore placed at one of the master's houses in the town of Rugby.
