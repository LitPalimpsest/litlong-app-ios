The first place we passed was the seat of Dr Langlands, M.D., a very pleasing place, about a mile above Hawick on the Teviot ; of late it was in possession of Lord Napier, and much improved by him, and is now bought by James Anderson, Esq., a younger brother of St Germains. In a mile or two further we reached the fine seat of the family of Buccleuch, the Castle of Branx- holm, which an ancestor of that family exchanged.    "},{"title":"Autobiography of the Rev.

But they were too late in marching ; for when they came to St Germains, their scouts, who were chiefly Lords Home and Loudon, brought them intelligence that the rebel army were on their march, on which, after an hour's halt, when, by turning to the left, they might have reached the high ground at Tranent before the rebels, they marched on to that plain before described, now called the field of battle. This field was entirely clear of the crop, the last sheaves having been carried in the night before; and neither cottage, tree, or bush were in its whole extent, except one solitary thorn bush which grew on the march between Seaton and Preston fields, around and near to which lay the greatest number of slain, and which remains there to this day, though the fields have been long since completely enclosed.

He had, almost by his single and unassisted talents, stopped the irruption of the banded force of all the Highland chiefs ; there was little doubt, that, with the slightest encouragement, he could put them all in motion, and renew the civil war; and it was well known that the most flattering overtures had been transmitted to the duke from the court of St Germains. The character and temper of Scotland was still little known, and it was considered as a volcano, which might, indeed, slumber for a series of years, but was still liable, at a moment the least expected, to break out into a wasteful eruption.
