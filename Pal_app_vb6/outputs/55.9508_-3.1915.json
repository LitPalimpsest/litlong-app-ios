On proceeding down Market Street, he perceived a confused crowd, some uttering threats, and others with consternation expressed on their countenance; and, in the midst of the multitude, was Serjeant Dickson, a young woman, and a drummer-boy, beating up for recruits. The white cockade streamed from the hat of the serjeant; the popidace vented their indignation against him, but no man dared to seize him, for he continued to turn round and round, with a blunderbuss in his hand, facing the crowd on all sides, and threatening to shoot the fii'st man that approached, who was not ready to serve the Prince, and to mount the white cockade.

Instead of turning purple in the lips at such a bold proposal, they \"staggered not at the promise through unbelief\" and in ten days they brought me the deed of the land paid for to the uttermost dollar! I resigned Market Street Church immediately, and on the next Sabbath morning, while the Easter bells were ringing under a dark stormy sky, I came over and faced, for the first time, the courageous founders of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church. The dear old Market Street Church lingered on for a few years more, bleeding at every pore, from the fatal up-town migration, and then peacefully disbanded.

The solid stone edifice was purchased by some generous Presbyterians in the upper part of the city, who organized there the \"Church of the Sea and Land,\" which is standing to-day, as a well-manned light-house amid a dense tenement-house foreign population.
