It is styled, however, in the earliest titles extant, \" the old land formerly of George, Bishop of Dunkeld;\" so that its foundation may be referred with every probability to the reign of James V., when George Crighton, who occupied that see from the year 1527 to 1543,\"sounded the hospital of St Thomas near the Water-gate, about two years before his death, and endowed it for the maintenance of certain chaplains and bedemen, \" to celebrate the founder's anniversary obit, by solemnly singing in the choir of Holyrood church, on the day of his death yearly, the Placebo and Dirige, for the repose of his soul,\" Sec.3 There can be little doubt moreover that the old land, which was only demolished in the year 1789, was the same mansion of Lord Hcjme, to which Queen Mary retreated with Darnley, on her return to Edinburgh in 1566, while she was haunted with the horrible recollections of the recent murder of her favourite, Rizzio, and her mind revolted from the idea of returning to the palace, the scene of his assassination, whose blood-stained floors still called for justice and revenge against the murderers. \" Vpoun the xviij day of the said moneth of March,\" says the contemporary annalist,4 \" our soueranis lonl and ladic, accumpanijt with tua thowsand horssmen come to Edinburgh, and lugeit not in thair palicc of Halyrudhous, bot lugeit in my lord Home's lugeing, callit the auld bischope of Dunkell his lugeing, anent the salt trone in Edinburgh; and the lordis being with thame for the tyme, wes lugeit round about thame within the said burgh.\"    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Holyrood","snippet":"From the various incidents adduced, it appears evident that Robert Gourlay was not only a subservient courtier, but also that he was so far dependent on the King\u2014whatever may have been the nature of his office\u2014as to place his house at his Majesty's free disposal, whenever it suited his convenience.3 It is well known that King James was very condescending in his favours to his loyal citizens of Edinburgh, making no scruple, when the larder of Holyrood grew lean, and the privy purse was exhausted, to give up housekeeping for a time, and honour one or other of the substantial burghers of his capital with a visit of himself and household; or when the straitened mansions within the closes of old Edinburgh proved insufficient singly to accommodate the hungry train of courtiers, he would very considerately distribute his favours through the whole length of the close ! In January 1591, for example, as we learn from Moysic,4 when \" the King and Queen's Majesties lodged themselves in Nicol Edward's house, in Niddry's Wynd,\" the Chancellor withdrew to Alexander Clark's house, at the same wynd head ; and, it is added, \" on the 7th of February, the Earl of Huntly, with his friends, to the number of five or six score horse, passed from his Majesty's said house in Edinburgh, intending to pass to a horse race in Leith.\" We are not quite sure if we are to understand that the whole six score were actually lodgers in the wynd, but it is quite obvious, at least, that his Majesty found his quarters there much too comfortable to be likely to quit \" his said house\" in a hurry.
