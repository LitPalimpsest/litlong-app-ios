Some of these  were not all that dissimilar to smells he had encountered  before \u2013 mice, for instance, smelled roughly similar  whether they infested the cellars and cupboards of the  New Town or the gardens of South Edinburgh. That smell,  at least, was familiar, but lawn seed was entirely new to  Cyril, as was the smell that came off a bundle of green  garden string, and the smell of a dead bat that had been  trapped somewhere up in the shed's roof.

Matthew could not help the way he talked,  which was in the accent of South Edinburgh, refined  perhaps here and there as a result of his education at  Watson's. If he did not sound as Scottish as Big Lou's  braid Scots, then that showed that you should never judge  a book by its cover, nor a person by his voice.    "}]
