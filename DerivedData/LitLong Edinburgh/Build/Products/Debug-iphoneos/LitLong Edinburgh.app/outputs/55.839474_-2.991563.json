Much of Scottish history has been made by the men who, from one generation to another, lived and died within that narrow limit ; and old George Dundas and Dame Katherine Oliphant little thought what an important part was to be played by the descendants of the younger son, for whom they thriftily saved money, and bought the Mains of Arniston.

' Why\/ says I, ' did ever mortal coming from England to Edinburgh go by Gifford, Crichton Castle, Borthwick Castle, and over the top of Blackford Hill ? Not only is it a circuitous detour, but there never was a road that way since the world was created!' 'That is a most irrelevant objection,' said Sir Walter ; ' it was my good pleasure to bring Marmion by that route, for the purpose of describing the places you have mentioned, and the view from Blackford Hill \u2014 it was his business to find his road and pick his steps the best way he could. But, pray, how would you have me bring him ? Not by the post-road, surely, as if he had been travelling in a mail-coach ?

They whirled through Lauder, where Archibald Douglas, or \" Bell the Cat,\" of Tantallon Castle, seized and promptly hanged Cochrane, a worthless favorite of King James III; they caught sight of the fifteenth-century keep of Crichton Castle on the right and, on their left, of Borthwick Castle, with a room in which Queen Mary and Bothwell once passed the night. Then it seemed but a very short time until familiar Arthur's Seat appeared before them, and they left the train at the Waverley Station.

He was met on the way by Crichton--evidently an accomplished courtier, and full of all the habits and ways of diplomacy--who invited the cavalcade to turn aside and rest for a day or two in Crichton Castle, where everything had been prepared for their reception. Here amid all the feastings and delights the great official discoursed to the young noble about the duties of his rank and the necessity of supporting the King's government and establishing the authority of law over the distracted country, sweetening his sermon with protestations of his high regard for the Douglas name, whose house, kin, and friends were more dear to him than any in Scotland, and of affection to the young Earl himself.
