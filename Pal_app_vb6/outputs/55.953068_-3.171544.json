His image was always clad in successive uniforms, as he was hurried through the different grades, until he reached the rank of Marshal-general of the armies of Portugal and Algarve, a post which, I believe, he yet holds, with a pension of one hundred and fifty ducats per annum, which every year is punctually deposited in a splendid purse, in the Chapel Royal, by the Portuguese sovereign. Awful was the wrath, and terrible were the denunciations and holy indignation, when a cannonball carried off the head and cocked hat of the unfortunate image, which had been placed in an open carriage on one occasion, when commanding the Portuguese army in battle.

During the time his father was engaged building the noble halls and Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle, the ill-fated lady whose tale I am about to tell, then in her fifteenth year, was introduced at court by her father. The susceptible young Duke of Rothesay, who had been little else than a prisoner in the hands of his father's turbulent nobles, fell in love with the young beauty, and paid her what civility the strict surveillance of Shaw of Sauchie would permit.

There is a little room in the castle known as the \" Douglas room,\" from the circumstance that King James II., who was born in Stirling, had given the \"Black Douglas\" safe conduct, but whom the king stabbed nevertheless, and threw his body out of the window, into the garden beneath, in a sudden fit of ungovernable passion.

The royal vault was broken into by the revolutionary mob that spoiled the Chapel Royal in 1688, and it was again rifled after the fall of the roof in 1768 in consequence of the folly of those employed to repair it, who loaded it with a covering of huge flagstones, of a weight altogether disproportioned to the strength and age of the walls.
