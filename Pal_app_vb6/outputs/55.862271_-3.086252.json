The Castle Park spreads out to the south, the scene of sport, both for noble and yeoman ; and the churchyard of Greyfriars, hard by, is hallowed by the 'dust of ancient martyrs, and made picturesque by the hand of modern taste. But it is hopeless to attempt to record all the features of interest pertaining to Stirling Castle.    "}]
