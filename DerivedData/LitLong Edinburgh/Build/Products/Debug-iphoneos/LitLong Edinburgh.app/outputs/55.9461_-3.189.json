That his day had been bad, his temper gave out, for, with an oath that consigned St. Giles and all the saints on the calendar to everlasting perdition, he tuimed his bag of all the stale bread and bones the charity of the gudewives of the Toun had burdened him with, on the ground, and kicked the heap viciously and contemptuously under his seat with his heels, after whilk he proceeded to finger his siller, whilk, I judged, from the unseemly language he used, and the way he misca'd the carlines between hands, to be not overly great.

The somewhat pretentious public school on Marshall Street was built upon General's Entry.

I liked him far better as I had heard him in Glasgow, at the United Associate Synod, defending himself on some knotty question, on which he differed from all his brethren, for two hours, in a speech which seemed one long sentence, and which at every pore coruscated with eloquence or with wit; or as I heard him on the Irish Education Measure, at a public meeting in Broughton Chapel, astonishing his very foes by the readiness, richness, and power of his oratory, and electrifying the most fastidious audience in Europe.
