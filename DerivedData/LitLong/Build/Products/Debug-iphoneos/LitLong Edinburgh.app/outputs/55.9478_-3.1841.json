She could read fluently, and as they hadwandered down by Drummond Street to the Pleasance, shesoon made out the sign of John Gilpie, licensed broker, andat once entered the shop and opened up her business. The hideous face of the miser frightened her, as it had oftenfrightened those of older growth; but the thought of Billynerved her on, and she managed to make her shaking handsundo the locket, and placed it in his hands with the words\u2014\" If you please, sir, will you buy that ? \"\" Can't buy it from you\u2014not allowed to buy from children,\"he snarled, with a look that curdled her blood.
