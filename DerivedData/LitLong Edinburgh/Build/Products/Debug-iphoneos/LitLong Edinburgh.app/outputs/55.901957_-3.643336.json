From the Parliament Square the office was removed to Lord Covington's house, above described ; thence, after some years, to a house in North Bridge Street ; and thence, finally, to the present extensive buildings in Waterloo Place.

The lands that formed the east side of this close still remain in North Bridge Street, presenting, doubtless, to the eye of every tasteful reformer, offensive blemishes in the modern thoroughfare; yet this unpicturesque locality has peculiar claims on the interest of every lover of Scottish poetry, for here, on the 5th of September 1750, the gifted child of genius, Robert Ferguson, was born. The precise site of his father's dwelling is unknown, but now that it has been transformed by the indiscriminating hands of modern improvers, this description may suffice to suggest to some, as they pass along that crowded thoroughfare, such thoughts as the dwellers in cities are most careless to encourage.2    "},{"title":"Lucy, Francis and Cousin Bill.
