Edinburgh Castle could not be conceived, much less built, nowadays, when all our energy is consumed in bettering the condition of the 'submerged tenth'! What did they care about the 'masses,' that 'regal race that is now no more,' when they were hewing those blocks of rugged rock and piling them against the sky-line on the top of that great stone mountain! It amuses me to think how much more picturesque they left the world, and how much better we shall leave it; though if an artist were requested to distribute individual awards to different generations, you could never persuade him to give first prizes to the centuries that produced steam laundries, trolleys, X rays, and sanitary plumbing.

By an additional variation the church bells might be rung through the same agency, not merely almost together, but at the same precise instant the blow would be struck, and one universal roar of bells resound from Land's End to John O'Groat's.

Thus, in the year 1746, that party of His Britannic Majesty's Light Dragoons, who, under an officer, brought to Edinburgh Castle the captive Duchess of Perth and the Viscountess of Strathallan, treated these noble ladies with every indignity, stripped the Ladies Mary and Amelia Drummond of their clothes, and tore the wedding-rings from their fingers with their teeth, just as the \" faith-* ful \" sepoys did to our women at Cawnpore, or as certain gallant Cosacks might do in Warsaw today.
