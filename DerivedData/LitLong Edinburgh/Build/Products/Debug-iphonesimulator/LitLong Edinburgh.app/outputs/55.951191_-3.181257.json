An open book is inscribed with the first verse of the Scottish metre version of the 133d Psalm,\u2014a motto that appears to have been in special repute, towards the close of the seventeenth century, among the suburban corporations, being also inscribed over the Tailors' Hall of Easter Portsburgh and the Shoemakers' Land in the West Port. The turnpike stair,\u2014the entrance to which is graced by this motto, and the further inscription, in smaller letters, it is an honour for man to cease from strife,\u2014rises above the roof of the building, and is crowned with an ogee roof of singular character, flanked on either side by picturesque gables to the street.

He latterly rode in this fantastic annual pageant in ermined robes, attended by prince, premier, champion in armour, and courtiers of all degrees, mounted on horseback, and decked in the most gaudy costume they could procure, until at length the whole wealth and property of the corporation were dissipated in this childish foolery, and King Crispin retired to private life, and the humbler relaxation of cobbling shoes ! Mrs Malcolm, an old dame of a particularly shrewish disposition, who inhabited an attic in the Shoemakers' Land towards the close of last century, was long known by the title of the Princess her husband having for many years represented the Black Prince, and she his sable consort,\u2014two essential characters in King Crispin's pageant. There can be little doubt that this frivolous sport was a relic of much earlier times, when the Cordiners of the neighbouring capital, incorporated in the year 1449, proceeded annually, on the anniversary of their patron saint, to the altar of St Crispin and St Crispinian, founded and maintained by them in the collegiate church of St Giles.1 Nor is it improbable, that in the princess a traditional remembrance was preserved of the Queen of the Canongate, mentioned in the Treasury accounts of James IV.
