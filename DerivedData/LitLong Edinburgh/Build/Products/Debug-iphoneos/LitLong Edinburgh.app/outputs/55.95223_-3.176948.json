We are sorry in any degree to disturb a tradition backed by such incontrovertible evidence; but it appears probable, from the evidence of the title-deeds, that the Golfer's Land was lost, instead of won, by the gaming propensities of its owner. It was acquired in 1609 by Nicol Paterson, maltman in Leith, from whom it passed in 1632 to his son, John Paterson, and Agnes Lyel, his spouse.
