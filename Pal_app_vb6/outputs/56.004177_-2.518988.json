A troop of volunteers, about sixty in number, comprehending the Dukes of Douglas and Roxburghe, the Earls of Haddington, Lauderdale, Loudon, Belhaven, and Rothes, fought bravely, though the policy of risking such a troupe doree might be questionable. At all events, it marked a great change of times, when the Duke of Douglas, whose ancestors could have raised an army as numerous as those of both sides in the field of Sheriffmuir, fought as a private trooper, assisted only by two or three servants.

In the middle distance you have the picturesque grounds of Belhaven, and the rugged coast of Dunbar with its burgh, and the ruins of its historical castle, where Black Agnes defied the Montague, also the mansion and grounds of the Earl of Lauderdale. A little to the east lies the battle ground whereon Cromwell secured, by the defeat of Leslie, the government of Scotland, and blessed by relieving it for some eight years of the bungling misgovernment of the Stuarts.
