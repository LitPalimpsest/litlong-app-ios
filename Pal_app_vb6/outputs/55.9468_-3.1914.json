In 1591, the citizens were empowered, by Parliament, to raise money on all lands and rents within Edinburgh, towards strengthening the town, by an addition of height and thickness to its walls, with forcing places, bulwarks, or flankers, &c. ;4 and finally, the common council having, in 1618, bought from Tours of Innerleith, ten acres of land at the Greyfriars' Port, they immediately ordered it to be enclosed with a wall, a considerable portion of which forms the western boundary of the Heriot's Hospital grounds. It only remains to be added, that the last attempt made to render these walls an effective defence, was in the memorable year 1745 ; with how little success has already been narrated.

That the monastery was a sumptuous foundation, according to the times, is proved by its being assigned for the temporary abode of the Princess, Mary of Guelders, who immediately after her arrival at Leith, in June 1449, proceeded on horseback, behind the Count de Vere, to her lodging in the Convent of the Greyfriars in Edinburgh, and there she was visited by her royal lover, James II., on the following day.1 A few years later it afforded an asylum to Henry VI. of England, when he fled to Scotland, accompanied by his heroic Queen, Margaret, and their son, Prince Edward, after the fatal battle of Towton.
