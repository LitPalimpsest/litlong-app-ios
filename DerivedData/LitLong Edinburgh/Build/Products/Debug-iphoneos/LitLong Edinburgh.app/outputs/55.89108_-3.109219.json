My road lay over a plain leading up the stream ofthe North Esk ; but I soon left it, to follow the winding and broken banks, and to get a peep at Melville Castle, the seat of Lord Melville. The principal building is square, with a round tower at each angle ; and crowned with battlements in imitation ofthe old Gothic castles.    "}]
