William Meek of Dunsyre was wont to quote the above inscription as a curious sample of the Latinity of the dominies of the Upper Ward, putting special emphasis on the rendering of Blacklaw, near Newbigging, by \" Nigram Legem, prope Novam ^Edificationem,\" and the fine conceit of Thomson in styling himself \" ludimagister \" and \" rector \" of the Academy of Walston.' Adam Thomson tracking his father's murderers like a sleuth-hound, .and then offering up a solemn prayer - ' an exercise of which he was very fond ' at  their gallows, is worthy of Matthew Wald and thai fell shoemaker M'Ewan, whose predestinarian meditations  on the sands at Lamlash, none who have read Lockhart's intense novel are likely to forget.
