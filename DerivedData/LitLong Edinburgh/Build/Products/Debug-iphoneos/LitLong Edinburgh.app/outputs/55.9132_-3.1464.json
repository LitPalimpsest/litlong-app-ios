In  November 1952, nine months after Elizabeth became Queen but  seven months before her coronation in Westminster Abbey, a new  Royal Mail pillar box bearing the legend 'EIIR' is installed on the  corner of  Sir Walter Scott Avenue and Gilmerton Road. Three days  later its bright red paint is covered with tar.    "}]
