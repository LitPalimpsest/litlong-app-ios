In 1721, the Treasurer of the Hospital complains of the expense incurred in prosecuting offenders in the case of some murders commitied within the regality; but these onerous and costly privileges were at length abrogated in 1746, by the act abolishing heritable jurisdictions, and the Governors a few years afterwards granted the use of the Tolbooth to one of their tenants as a storehouse, \" reserving to the Hospital a room for holding their baron courts when they shall think fit.\"2 The last occasion on which Old Broughton was directly associated with any event of public importance, was during the memorable campaign of 1650, which preceded the battle of Dunbar, when General Leslie made it his head quarters, while he threw up the line of defence from the base of the Calton Hill to Leith, which we have already described as the origin of the great causeway that now forms the chief thoroughfare between Edinburgh and Leith.
