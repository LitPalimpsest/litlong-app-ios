[{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Bakehouse Close","snippet":"But, at any rate, an examination of the evidence referred to leaves no doubt that the Mint was situated at the period entirely without the Canongate, and in the outer court of the Palace of Holyrood,3 though this has not prevented the historian being followed, as usual, without investigation by later writers. We have engraved a view of this curious old mansion as it appears from the Bakehouse Close. It presents an exceedingly picturesque row of timber-fronted gables to the street, resting on a uniform range of ornamental corbels projecting from the stone basement story.    "}]
