[{"title":"Penelope's Experiences in Scotland; Being Extracts from the Commonplace Book of Penelope Hamilton","author":"Wiggin, Kate Douglas Smith","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1217","placename":"Corstorphine Hill","snippet":"We looked down over the grassy chasm that separates the New from the Old Town; looked our first on Arthur's Seat, that crouching lion of a mountain; saw the Corstorphine Hill, and Calton heights, and Salisbury Crags, and finally that stupendous bluff of rock that culminates so majestically in Edinburgh Castle. There is something else which, like Susanna Crum's name, is absolutely and ideally right! Stevenson calls it one of the most satisfactory crags in nature--a Bass rock upon dry land, rooted in a garden, shaken by passing trains, carrying a crown of battlements and turrets, and describing its warlike shadow over the liveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the new town.

From the west gate, looking west, you see a large public park, with a long avenue between two rows of trees, and Fettes CoUege, whde in the distance, and south of the Forth Bridge, is seen Corstorphine Hill, where Prince Charlie's troops rested before the battle of Prestonpans. The pond, where the water lilies and other water plants spread out their leaves and inhale the refreshing draught, is also interesting, as also to watch the water-hens move about, or listen to the music of the birds which regularly flock about this happy sporting ground.

To the south it adjoined another house, but standing in so large a garden as to be well out of cry; on all other sides, open fields stretched upward to the woods of Corstorphine Hill, or backward to the dells of Ravelston, or downward towards the valley of the Leith. The effect of seclusion was aided by the great height of the garden walls, which were, indeed, conventual and, as John had tested in former days, defied the climbing schoolboy.
