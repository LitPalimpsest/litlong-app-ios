A narrow passage led between these shops and the west end of St Giles' ; and George Heriot's shop, being in the centre of the three, was situated exactly opposite to the south window of the Little    "},{"title":"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches: with elucidations.","author":"Cromwell, Oliver","year":"1845-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=yale.39002008273931","placename":"Signet Library","snippet":"The sentence was not delivered till April, 1638 ; and then it went his Highland Tour, named his mare Jenny Geddes.
