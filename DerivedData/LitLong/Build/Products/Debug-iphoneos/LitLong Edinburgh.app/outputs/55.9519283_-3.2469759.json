When he had no dinner engagement, he frequently gave a few hours to the theatre  ; but still more frequently, when the weather was fine, and still more, I believe, to his own satisfaction, he drove out with some of his family, or a single friend, in an open carriage ; the favourite rides being either to the Blackford Hills, or to Ravelston, and so home by Cor- storphine ; or to the beach of Portobello, where Peter was always instructed to keep his horses as near as possible  to the sea. More than once, even in the first summer  of my acquaintance with him, I had the pleasure of accompanying him on these evening excursions ; and never did he seem to enjoy himself more fully than when placidly surveying, at such sunset or moonlight hours, either the massive outlines of his \" own romantic town,\" or the tranquil expanse of its noble estuary.
