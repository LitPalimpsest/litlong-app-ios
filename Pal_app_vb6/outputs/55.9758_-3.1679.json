A large and strong bastion, which bore the name of Ramsay's Fort, was constructed immediately to the north of the King's Work, at the foot of Bernard Street, for the defence of the harbour; from thence the ramparts extended, in a south-easterly direction, to the site now occupied by the Exchange buildings, where the remains of the second bastion existed about forty    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Bernard Street","snippet":"Frequent mention is made by early historians of the King's Work, an extensive building that appears to have occupied the whole ground between the Broad Wynd and Bernard Street.

The locality retained the name of Bernard's Nook, derived from its occupation by the royal servitor; and that of Bernard Street, which is now conferred on the broad thoroughfare that leads eastward from the Shore, still preserves a memorial of the favourite ehamber-chield of James VI. A large stone pannel which bears the date 1650\u2014 the year immediately succeeding the appropriation of the King's Work to civic purposes, \u2014appears on the north gable of the old Weigh House now occupying its site, with the curious device of a rainbow carved in bold relief, springing at either end from a bank of clouds.
