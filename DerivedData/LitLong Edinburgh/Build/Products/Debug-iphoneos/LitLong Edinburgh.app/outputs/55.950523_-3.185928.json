[{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Barringer's Close","snippet":"The house stands within the close, on the west side. On the first floor a small niche appears, at the right side of the doorway, immediately on entering, and in the opposite wall there is another of large size, and a highly ornamental character,\u2014 though now dilapidated, and greatly obscured with white wash,\u2014through which a window has been broken, looking into Barringer's Close. Alongside of the latter niche a narrow turnpike stair has formerly afforded access to the floor above, and the general construction of the apartment, renders it exceedingly probable that it may have been used as a private chapel before the Reformation.
