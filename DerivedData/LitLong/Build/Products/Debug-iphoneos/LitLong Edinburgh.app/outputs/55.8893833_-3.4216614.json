So marching was rough and weary work, yet Quentin never flinched, as they proceeded by the dark, heathy, and solitary hills of the Muirkirk-of-Kyle, by Carnwath, where a party of the Gordon Highlanders, under Logan of that ilk, joined them, and by Kirknewton, where, from an eminence over which the roadway wound, he saw, for the first time, the wooded expanse  of the beautiful Lothians, with the swelling outline of Arthur's Seat, the blue Firth, widening to a sea, the fertile hills of Fife, the lordly Ochil mountains, and those of thirteen counties, stretching  far away even to the distant Lammermuirs, and in the middle distance, grey, dim, and smoky, the \" Queen of the North, upon her hilly throne.\" Then the soldiers hailed her with a cheer and a roll on the drums, announcing that there ended their last day's march.
