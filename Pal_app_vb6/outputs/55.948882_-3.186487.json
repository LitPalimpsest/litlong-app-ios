The old concert gentlemen said that his compositions wanted the solidity and full harmony of Handel and Corelli ; and when the celebrated leader \u2014 the elder Cramer \u2014 visited St Cecilia's Hall, and played a spirited charming overture of Haydn's, an old amateur next to whom I was seated asked me, \" Whase music is that, now?\" \" Haydn's, sii-,\" said I. \" Poor newfangled stuff,\" he replied ; \" I hope I shall never hear it again ! \" Many years have since rolled away, and rnark what some among us now say : \u2014 A friend calling lately on an old lady much in the fashionable circle of society, heard her give directions to the pianist who was teaching her nieces to bring them some new and fashionable pieces of music, but no more of the unfashionable compositions of Haydn ! Alas for those ladies whose taste in music is regulated by fashion, and who do not know that the music of Haydn is the admiration and delight of all the real lovers and judges of the art in Europe !

They did such honour to Edinburgh, nearly for half a century, that I feel myself called on to make a brief record of them, and am glad to be enabled to do so by a living authority, one of the most fervent worshippers in the temple of the goddess.

Only six years before the commencement of the works beyond the North Loch, Sir Robert Mylne was employed to furnish the design for St Cecilia's Hall, in the Cowgate. It was built after the model of the great theatre Farnese at Parma, and though now long deserted by the votaries of St Cecilia, it was admirably adapted for the purposes of a concert-room ; its oval forni and elliptical ceiling, as well as the skilful arrangement of the seats, uniting to convey every note clear and distinct to the auditors.

In this respect the great Music Hall of the New Town is decidedly inferior, notwithstanding the lapse of above eighty years since the building of St Cecilia's Hall, and the great attention devoted in the interval to the practical application of acoustics in architecture. The professional skill of Craig was almost entirely exercised on tlie private dwellings of the first emigrants to the extended royalty; and such of these as have escaped remodelling, in the rapid changes of taste and uses that have taken place of late years, exhibit little that is calculated to gratify the eye.

He used to tell that, on alighting at Ramsay's Inn, opposite the Cowgate Port, his first impression of the city was so unfavourable, that he was on the point of leaving it again, without further acquaintance, and was only prevented from doing so by the solicitations of his fellow- traveller, who was not so much alarmed at the dingy and squalid appearance of this part of Auld Reekie.* He was first employed at St Cecilia's Hall, where the concerts were attended by all the ' rank, beauty, and fashion ' of which Edinburgh could then boast, and where, besides the professional performers, many amateurs of great musical skill and enthusiasm, such as Mr Tytler of Woodhouselee, t were pleased to exhibit themselves, for the entertain-    "},{"title":"Traditions of Edinburgh.","author":"Chambers, Robert","year":"1847-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t80k29d0q","placename":"St Cecilia's Hall","snippet":"' The concerts of St Cecilia's Hall formed one of the most liberal and attractive amusements that any city in Europe could boast of. The hall was built on purpose at the foot of Niddry's Wynd, by a number of public-spirited noblemen and gentlemen ; and the expense of the concerts was defrayed by about two hundred subscribers, paying two or three guineas each annually ; and so respectable was the institution considered, that upon the death of a member, there were generally several applications for the vacancy, as is now the case with the Caledonian Hunt.
