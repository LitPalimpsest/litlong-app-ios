At the Theatre Royal, in Liverpool, the other evening, I was about entering theboxes with a lady on my arm, who wore on theback of her head a little \" love of a bonnet,\" aboutthe size of a japonica flower, when she was arrestedby an usher, who politely informed her that the forbidden bonnet must be left in the ante-room.
