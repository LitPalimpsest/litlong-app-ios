One of the carved stones from the modern portion of the building,\u2014 apparently the centre crow-step that crowned the gable,\u2014is now preserved, among other relics of similar character, in the nursery of Messrs Eagle and Henderson, Leith Walk. It bears on it the city arms, sculptured in high relief, and surmounted by an ornamental device with the date 1641.

The principal approach to Leith, however, continued for nearly a century after this to be by the Eastern Road, through the Water Gate; and the present broad and handsome thoroughfare, which still retains the name of Leith Walk, was then simply an elevated gravel path. The origin of this valuable modern improvement is strangely traceable to one of the most disastrous campaigns of the seventeenth century.

The right wing of the Scottish army rested upon the high grounds at the rise of the mountain called Arthur's Seat, and the left wing was posted at Leith ; while the high bank, formerly called Leith Walk, made a part of his lines, which, defended by a numerous artillery, completely protected the metropolis. Cromwell skirmished with the Scottish advanced posts near to Restalrig, but his cuirassiers were so warmly encountered that they gained no advantage, and their general was obliged to withdraw to Musselburgh.

The carved stone is now preserved in the nursery of Messrs Eagle and Henderson, Leith Walk.    "},{"title":"Fraud and Friendship; or the orphan and the foundling of the King's printing-house.

It has since been converted, at great expense, into one of the broadest and most substantial causeways in the kingdom, along which handsome streets and squares are now laid out, destined, when completed, to unite the capital and its seaport into one great city ; but it still retains, in its name of Leith Walk, a memento of the period when it was carefully guarded for the exclusive use of pedestrian travellers. About half way between Edinburgh and Leith, on the west side of the Walk, is the site of the Gallow-Lee, once a rising ground, whose summit was decorated with the hideous apparatus of public execution, permanently erected there for the exposure of the mangled limbs of notorious culprits or political offenders.
