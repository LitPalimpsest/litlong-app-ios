Out of  the blue David Eddelstane announced that he would  not be seeking re-election as MP for Glenallan and West Mills. There he was on the evening news outside a Glasgow hotel, looking  like he was going to throw up, with his wife beside him looking  equally sick as he read from a prepared statement and said that after  he'd fi nished reading it he would not be answering questions or giving  interviews.
