At a greater distance, on the other hand, the romantic Pentlands spread out their wild variety of rock and glen, with the green woods of Dreghorn stretching along near their base; and the picturesque hills of Craiglockhart, Braid, and Blackford, extending from that direction towards the town, and many a fair wood and mansion, and sunny field, lying smiling on either hand between.
