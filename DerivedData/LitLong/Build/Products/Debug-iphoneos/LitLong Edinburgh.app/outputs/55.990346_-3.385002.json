One can picture too as he himself does, the romantic boys ofto-day following the wanderings of David Balfour by Broughton andSilver-mills, the Water of Leith, the Hawes Inn at Queensferry, and thewind-swept shores of the Forth. But one can still more clearly see thatslim, brown-eyed youth--a-quiver with the eagerness that was soconspicuous a characteristic of his,--as in these very places heremembered bygone tales and even then formed plans for, and saw visionsof, his own stories yet to be.
