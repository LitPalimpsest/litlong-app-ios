We experienced on that occasion a pleasing mark of attention from one of our peasant neighbors, who lived between Rydal and Grasmere. The intelligence of this event reached the members of the Arnold family then at Fox How very early on Monday morning ; and this neighbor, knowing of my mother's illness, and of the great intimacy that subsisted between us, and fearing she might hear it suddenly in one of her daily drives, walked to Laiicrigg and reached it before 7 A. M. She asked to see me in my room. This enabled me, in some degree, to break the suddenness of the shock to my mother ; and it was a^pleasing testimony of the interest this neighbor took in both families. There was a long suspension  at this time, owing to her illness, of any continuation in her family records of the sad events of that summer, for in August of the same year the two youngest little boys of Dr and Mrs. Davy were cut off in one week by virulent scarlet fever, and interred in one grave in the West Church Cemetery in Edinburgh.

That was the time when the West Church for some successive weeks was filled, two galleries and all, at six each summer morning, by eager throngs, who came from every corner of Edinburgh, from Leith, from Portobello, from Fife, from villages six miles off in the country, to listen to what they deemed the voice of a new John Baptist, as well as to wonder at the man's marvellous powers. I was not then in Edinbm-gh; but hearing, in the spring of 1834, that he had revisited the city, I repaired to the small chapel in Carrubber's Close, where he had been in the habit of holding forth.
