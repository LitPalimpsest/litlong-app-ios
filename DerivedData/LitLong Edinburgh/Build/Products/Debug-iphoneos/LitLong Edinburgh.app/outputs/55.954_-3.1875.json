The site of James's Square, Shakspere Square, Leith Street, and all the grand improvements to the eastward, remains in a state of nature, St Ninian's Row extending its unbroken range to the foot of Leith Street. St Andrew's Church appears as occupying the Bite originally intended for it, on the open ground in front of the mansion afterwards built by Sir Laurence Dunda6, on the east side of St Andrew Square, and now occupied as the Royal Bank of Scotland.
