Roseburn House, a very interesting old mansion, where Cromwell is said to have passed the night, while the army lay encamped in its neighbourhood, still remains, bearing the date 1562 over its principal entrance. In levelling one of the neighbouring mounds some years since, some stone coffins were found, and a large quantity of human bones, evidently of a very ancient date, as they crumbled to pieces on being exposed to the air; but the tradition of the neighbouring hamlet is, that they were the remains of some of Cromwell's troopers.

Our informant, the present intelligent occupant of Roseburn House, mentioned the curious fact, that among the remains dug up, there were the bones of a human leg, with fragments of a wooden coffin or case, of the requisite dimensions, in which it had evidently been buried apart.
