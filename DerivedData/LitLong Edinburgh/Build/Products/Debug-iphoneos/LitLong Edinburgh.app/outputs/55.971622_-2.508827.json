It runs pretty close by the foot of Doon Hill ; forms, from this point to the sea, the boundary of Oliver's position ; his force is arranged in battle-order along the left bank of this Brocksburn, and its grassy glen ; he is busied all Monday, he and his Officers, in ranking them there. ' Before sunrise on Monday,' Lesley sent down his horse from the Hill-top, to occupy the other side of this Brook ; ' about four in the afternoon ' his train came down, his whole Army gradually came down ; and they now are ranking themselves on the opposite side of Brocksburn, \u2014 on rather narrow ground ; corn-fields, but swiftly sloping upwards to the steep of Doon Hill.

Hundred-and-seventeenth Psalm, at the foot of the Doon Hill ; there we uplift it, to the tune of Ban gor, or some still higher score, and roll it strong and great against the sky : 0 give ye praise unto the Lord, All nati-ons that be ; Likewise ye people all, accord His name to magnify ! For great to-us-ward ever are His lovingkindnesses; His truth endures forevermore : The Lord 0 do ye bless ! And now, to the chase again. The Prisoners are Ten-thousand, \u2014 all the foot in a mass.

At sight of this movement, Oliver suggests to Lambert stand ing by him, Does it not give us an advantage, if we, instead of him, like to begin the attack ? Here is the Enemy's right wing coming out to the open space, free to be attacked on any side ; and the main-battle hampered in narrow sloping ground between Doon Hill and the Brook, has no room to manoeuvre or assist :* beat this right wing where it now stands ; take it in flank and front with an overpowering force, \u2014 it is driven upon its own main-battle, the whole Army is beaten ?

It appears, from other quarters, that Lesley ivas advised or sanctioned in this attempt by the Committee of Estates and Kirk, but also that he was by no means hard to advise ; that, in fact, lying on the top of Doon Hill shelterless in such weather, was no operation to spin out beyond necessity ; \u2014 and that if anybody pressed too much upon him with advice to come down and sight, it was likeliest to be Royalist Civil Dignitaries, who had plagued him with their cavil lings at his cunctations, at his ' sacret fellow feeling for the Sec tarians and Regicides,' ever since this War began. The poor Scotch Clergy have enough of their own to answer for in this business ; let every back bear the burden that belongs to it.
