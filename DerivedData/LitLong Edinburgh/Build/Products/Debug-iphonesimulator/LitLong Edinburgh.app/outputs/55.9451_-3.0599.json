Many persons of consequence lived here : Lord Kames in a neat house at the top, on the east side \u2014 an edifice once thought so fine, that people used to bring their country cousins to see it ; Lord Hailes, in a house more than half-way down, now occupied by Mr Ruthven, mechanist ; Sir Philip Ainslie in another house in the same row.

Some of her domestics, however, were sent to lock up the house in New Street, and in closing the window-shutters. Lord Hailes's will dropped out upon the floor from behind a panel, and was found to secure her in the possession of his estates, which she enjoyed for upwards of forty yeai's.

A split in the company concerned here led to the erection, in 1746-7, of a theatre at the bottom of a t close in the Canongate, nearly opposite to the head of New Street. This house, capable of holding about \u00a370 \u2014 the boxes being half-a-crown, and pit one-and-sixpence \u2014 was for several years the scene of good acting under Lee, Digges, Mrs Bellamy, and Mrs Ward.

Even those modern districts connected with it, as St John Street, New Street, George Square, &c. were beginning to be forsaken for the sake of more elegantly-circumstanced habitations beyond the North Loch. Into the remote social consequences of this change it is not my purpose to enter, beyond the bare remark, that it was only too accordant with that tendency of our pi*esent form of civilisation to separate the high from the low, the intelligent from the ignorant \u2014 that dissociation, in short, which would in itself run nigh to be a condemnation of all progress, if we were not allowed to suppose that better forms of civilisation are realisable.
