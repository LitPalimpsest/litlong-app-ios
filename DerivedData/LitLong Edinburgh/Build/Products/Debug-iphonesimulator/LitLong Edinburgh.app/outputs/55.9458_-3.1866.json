This work was largely developed when in 1880 the congregation, at a cost of between \u00a33000 and \u00a34000, acquired commodious and thoroughly suitable premises, the Halls in Marshall Street. In these the various meetings connected with the Congregation and Mission have been carried on comfortably and with much success; and the Mission has not only been blessed to many families in the district, but has reacted in much blessing to the congregation itself, binding the membership together by common labour and association.

A much humbler locality this than that of Alison Square close at hand, but now similarly obliterated almost out of recognition, and named Marshall Street, in which Thomas Campbell, ten winters before, in a ' dusky lodging,' wrote the ' Pleasures of Hope.' Carlyle's companion was 'one Tom Small, who had already been to College last year.' ' Tom and I,' he says (vol. ii. p. 4), ' had entered Edinburgh, after twenty miles of walking, between two and three P.M., got a clean-looking most cheap lodging (Simon Square \u2014 the poor locality), had got ourselves brushed, some morsel of dinner perhaps, and Palinurus Tom sallied out into the street with me to show the novice mind a little of Edinburgh before sundown.'

The somewhat pretentious public school on Marshall Street was built upon General's Entry. On the 14th of January, 1787, Burns wrote: \"I went to a Mason lodge yesternight, where the M. W. Grand Master Charteris and all the Grand Lodge of Scotland visited.    "}]
