Dr. Mansfield once jocularly told him, his only chance of health would be to live on sixpence a-day, and to earn it himself, as he required so much exercise ; and therefore occasionally, when Sir Richard felt rather \" off his feed,\" as sportsmen express themselves, he extended his constitutional  walk as far as Ashgrove ; but he considered it a waste of time to sit down above ten minutes, and, with compliments to Lady Olivia on the appetizing effects of sea air, and a steady refusal of any refreshment that might endanger the full enjoyment of his approaching meal, he generally hastened on, giving a glance of anxious solicitude at his watch, to ascertain whether he had left ample time to reach home with his usual punctuality for dinner. If Sir Richard Fitz-Patrick could have been gifted with an unlimited power of eating and sleeping, his life would have been divided between these two states of enjoyment, for he knew nothing else that deserved the name of pleasure, and was often heard to declare, that the only thing in the twenty-four hours worth living for was the sound of the gong.

A great impediment in the way of their going to Ashgrove more frequently was, that both Lady Fitz-Patrick and Lady Howard had an instinctive  dread of visiting there alone. Lady Olivia had never made a censorious remark to either of them, but yet the tenor of her own occupations, pursuits, and opinions,  was so obviously at variance with theirs, that the whole course of her existence was inevitably felt as a sort    "},{"title":"Modern accomplishments, or, The march of intellect \/","author":"Sinclair, Catherine","year":"1841-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t4hm53v8z","placename":"Ashgrove","snippet":"Another of the family besides Eleanor seemed about this time to stand in need of excitement, and to be pining in restless inactivity, and in unwilling retirement  at Ashgrove, which had once been only a scene of peaceful contentment and active usefulness.

Her almost daily walk was now extended to reach Lady Olivia's residence ; and as Matilda and Miss Person cheerfully traced their steps along the quiet and secluded road which led to Ashgrove, they beguiled the distance with so many interesting subjects of discussion, that they were scarcely conscious of fatigue, and the cordial animated reception they invariably met with at last would have more than rewarded them for a pilgrimage  of twice the distance. There was not a plant in Lady Olivia's garden which had not a place in Matilda' s affection ; there was not a family in the neighbouring  village in whom she was not warmly interested ; and to her willing ear Lady Olivia imparted all her projected improvements, all her plans of beneficence, and even all her sorrows.

Matilda was therefore carefully secluded  from public view ; and as her chief enjoyment consisted in visiting Lady Olivia, and partaking in the various pleasures of country life, the frequency of her excursions to Ashgrove was redoubled, and no exertion seemed too great, if she could reap for a reward the privilege of being allowed to spend, if it were no more than half an hour iu her garden, or in the society of her    "},{"title":"Modern accomplishments, or, The march of intellect \/","author":"Sinclair, Catherine","year":"1841-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t4hm53v8z","placename":"Ashgrove","snippet":"Eleanor's visits to Lady Olivia became gradually from this time almost discontinued ; and she at last appeared to look back upon the pleasure of her former excursions to Ashgrove as an amusement of childhood which she had completely outgrown. Sometimes she went under shelter of her mother's wing, and was glad to make a hasty apologetic exit along with Lady Fitz- Patrick ; but her visits on Saturday were entirely relinquished ; there was always the excuse of a children's ball, where she was obliged to appear ; or she had been promised leave to attend the theatre as the reward of her last brilliant display ; or she was going with some gay party of pleasure,  who were to remain in the country from Saturday till Monday, enjoying a succession of delightful festivities.
