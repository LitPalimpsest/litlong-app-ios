When we came upon the poet Ramsay she seemed to have caught new vigour from the subject : she spoke with animation of the child-parties she had attended in his house on the Castlehill during a course of ten years before his death an event which happened in 1757. He was \"charming,\" she said; he entered so heartily into the plays of children.

It is a sight to stir the most prosaic mind to stand on Castlehill, to stand by the side of Mons Meg, the great and famous cannon, and look out over and beyond Edinburgh. There are few views in the world to surpass this, embracing as it does the high Arthur's Seat on the one hand; the stretch of the sea, with its glimpses of white sails; the Pentland Hills in the distance, and the irregular up-hill-and-down-dale town of Edinburgh, lying under a clear sky, with a faint, fine mist over the face of the scattered peaks and a flood of sunshine in the valley of the Gardens.

I forget, or never knew, what time they had come to Templand, but guess it may have been in 1822 or shortly after ; dates of Castlehill and Strathmilligan I never knew, even order of dates ; last summer I could so easily have known (deaf-and-dumb \"Mr. Turner,\" an old Strathmilligan acquaintance, recognized by her in the Dumfries Railway Station, and made to speak by paper and pencil, I writing for her because she could not).

His family meanwhile had been scattered abroad, seeking their various fortune ; son John to Liverpool (where he had one or perhaps more uncles of mercantile distinction), son William to the West Indies (?) and to early death, whom I often heard lamented by my mother-in-law ; these and possibly others who were not    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Castlehill","snippet":"Within this close, towards the west, there is a plain substantial land now exposed to view by the Castle Road, originally possessed by Elizabeth, Countess Dowager of Hyndford, and sold by her in the year 1740, to Henry, the last Lord Holyroodhouse, who died at his house in the Canongate in 1755.l Various ancient closes, and very picturesque front lands that formed the continuation of the southern side of the Castle Hill, have been swept away to give place to the new Western Approach and the Assembly Hall. One of these, Ross's Court, contained \" The great Marquis of Argyle's House, in the Castlehill,\" described by Creech, in his \" Fugitive Pieces,\" as inhabited, at that degenerate period, by a hosier, at a rental of \u00b0f?12 per annum.

In whatever direction he looked, from the ridgy heights of the Castlehill, a glorious natural picture met his eye. If to the north, his gaze caught the gleam of the silvery estuary of the Forth, with fertile reaches of green pasture-land intervening, and the little villages of Picardy, Broughton, and Canonmills peeping out from embosoming foliage, while beyond the silver streak, beautified by the azure enchantment of distance, glowed in the sunshine the heath-clad Lomonds and the yellow wealth of the fields of Fife.

So did the Judges who stood next : then the Magistrates : the Faculty and other legal bodies : the Clergy : and all the spectators in the church-yard ; beyond whom it ran over the sky lines of people ridged on all the buildings, and on the southern edge of the Castlehill all stood for a moment silent and uncovered.

The dragoons, seeing but one or two men, received the proposal with a volley of curses and pistolballs, and having compelled the Jacobite commandant to retreat within the Thermopyl\u00e6 of Writers' Court, they continued their race up to the Castlehill, thinking that fortress the most secure place of refuge. Old General Preston, who had now thrown himself into the Castle, of which he was governor, and superseded General Guest in his office, had no idea of admitting these recreant cavaliers into a fortress which was probably on the eve of a siege.

The pipers themselves were mercifully hidden from us on that first occasion, and it was well, for we could never have borne another feather's weight of ecstasy.
