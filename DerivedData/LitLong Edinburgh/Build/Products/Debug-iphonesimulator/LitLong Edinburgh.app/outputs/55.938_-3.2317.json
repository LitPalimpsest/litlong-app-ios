For the next three months Maggie would sleepwalk out from  her room at Mrs McKenzie's, down the stairs, along Fountainbridge,  over the railway, past the graveyard, then sharp  right, down to the junction, across to the start of Gorgie  Road, under a railway bridge and straight on till she reached  Fusco's \u2013 and sleepwalk back again nine hours later.

Apart from the occasional car, its tyres  hissing on the wet cobbles, and the few late-night stragglers  making their way home, Gorgie Road was more or less deserted. She hurried along the pavement, side-stepping the puddles  and the occasional gush of rainwater from a rone pipe.    "}]
