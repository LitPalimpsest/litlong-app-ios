The town of Restalrig, the burgh of Broughton, and the several villages now inclosed within the New Town, all belong to the ancient suburban features of the Scottish capital ; and the description which has been given of the site of the New Town, and of its very singular antiquities, renders its present appearance a fit illustration to these pages. All these features are included in this map, which serves also to exhibit in some degree the striking contrast between the New and Old Town, though it is impossible, by means of any plan, to convey to a stranger a correct idea of the peculiar characteristics of the Scottish capital, arising from the singular inequalities of its site.

We are led to infer from the straitened proportions of this narrow alley, that the whole exports and imports of the shipping of Leith were conveyed on pack-horses, or in wheel-barrows, as it would certainly prove impassable for any larger wheeled conveyance.
