Perhaps, also, there was a difficulty inbringing the piece forward, while, of the personsagainst whom its satire was chiefly directed, Davenant was manager of the one theatre, and Drydena sharer in the other. The death of Davenant probably removed this difficulty : and the success ofDryden in the heroic drama; the boldness withwhich he stood forth, not only as a praetiser, butas the champion of that peculiar style ; a certainprovoking tone of superiority in his critical essays,which, even when flowing from conscious merit, isnot easily tolerated by contemporaries; and perhaps his situation as poet laureat, a post which hasbeen always considered as a fair butt for the shaftsof ridicule,\u2014induced Buckingham to resume theplan of his satire, and to place Dryden in the situation designed originally for Davenant or Howard.

Tonson, with reference to Dryden having offered a strange bookseller six hundred lines for twenty guineas, entersinto a question in the rule of three, by which hediscovers, and proves, that for fifty guineas he hasonly 1446 lines, which he seems to take more unkindly, as he had not counted the lines until he hadpaid the money ; from all which Jacob infers, thatDryden ought, out of generosity, at least to throwhim in something to the bargain, especially as hehad used him more kindly in Juvenal, which, saiththe said Jacob, is not reckoned so easy to translateas Ovid. What weight was given to this supplication does not appear; probably very little, for thetranslations were not extended; and as to gettingback any part of the copy-money, it is not probableTonson's most sanguine expectations ever reachedthat point.
