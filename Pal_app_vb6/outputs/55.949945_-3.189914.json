One or two of these old haunts of bygone generations still exist, and keep alive some of their favourite customs, known only to a few survivors of last century, or to the favoured proteges whom they have initiated into the mysteries practised by their forefathers ! Currie's tavern in Craig's Close, once the scene of meeting of various clubs, and a favourite resort of the merchants in the neighbourhood of the Cross, still retains a reputation among certain antiquarian bibbers, for an old fashioned luxury known by the name ofpap-in,- a strange compound of small beer and whisky, curried, as the phrase is, with a little oat-meal!

Another favorite resort of Ferguson's, where, \" wi' sang and glass he'd flee the power o' care, that wad harras the hour,\" was the Cape Club, which met at The Isle of Man's Arms, Craig's Close (265 High Street). In Craig's Close is still to be seen the broken-down and neglected sign of the Cockburn Tavern, in front of a broken-down and neglected tenement, about half-way up the close on the east side, with all of its flashes of merriment gone this many a year.

The scene of meeting for a considerable period, where Cape Hall was nightly inaugurated, was in James Mann's, at the Isle of Man arms, Craig's Close. There a perpetual High Jinks was kept up, by each member receiving on his election a peculiar name and character which he was ever afterwards expected to maintain.

Another richly carved stone, consisting of a decorated ogee arch with crocquets and finial, surmounted by shields, is built into a modern erection at the foot of Craig's Close, and nearly corresponds with one in a more dilapidated state in the Princes Street gardens, tending to show the important character of the buildings that formerly occupied this site. Among those in the gardens there is a lintel, bearing the Somerville arms, and the date 1658, with an inscription, now nearly defaced, and the initials I . S ., possibly those of James, tenth Lord Somerville ; but this was discovered in clearing out the bed of the North Loch.
