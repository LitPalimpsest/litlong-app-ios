Abercairney did not scruple to crave him every time they met, but his tenant never failed to have a ready excuse, and that ready excuse never failed to postpone the evil day.

But while the recollection of the Borough Moor has been thus preserved, the Borough Loch, its neighbour, has been less fortunate ; though, at the time when the poet represents Marmion as riding over Blackford, it must have formed as marked a feature in the landscape as the moor itself; it must have stretched a broad blue sheet of water between the half-felled forest and the city, the home of the pike and the perch, and the occasional haunt of the coot and the sea-gull; and its huge boulder-stones, one of which is even now yielding its ponderous bulk to the expansive force of gunpowder, and flinging up its fragments into the air, must have stood up along its sedgy shore, amid thickets of reeds and flags, and wide-spread shallows covered by the white flowering trefoil.
