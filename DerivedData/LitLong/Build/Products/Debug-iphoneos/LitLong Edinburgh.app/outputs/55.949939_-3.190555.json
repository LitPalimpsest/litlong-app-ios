On reaching  the house, where he was admitted upon the instant,  he found a counterpart of his own domestic tragedy \u2014 everything telling the tale of weariness, anxiety, and fear ; comers and goers with lugubrious  countenances ; and Mrs Blair herself in a chair    "},{"title":"Romances of the old town of Edinburgh \/","author":"Leighton, Alexander","year":"1867-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t9q23w570","placename":"Writers' Court","snippet":"Apart from the family in Peddie's Land, and in no manner connected with it, either by blood or favour, was that of Mr Archibald.

He found her in that state of reconciled despondency to which she had been reduced for more than two months ; but the moment she saw Patrick Halliday enter, she sprang up as if she had been quickened by the impulse of a new-born hope rising amidst the clouds of a long-    "},{"title":"Tales of a Grandfather ...
