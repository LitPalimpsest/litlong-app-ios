There is one on the sacred site of the old Globe Theatre, something like one where stood the Tabard Inn whence Chaucer started his immortal Pilgrims for Canterbury, and you will find a brazen gin palace if you search for \"The White Hart Inn,\" of \"Henry VI\" and \"Pickwick Papers.\" Poor old Southwark! Her glorious days of light have passed !    "}]
