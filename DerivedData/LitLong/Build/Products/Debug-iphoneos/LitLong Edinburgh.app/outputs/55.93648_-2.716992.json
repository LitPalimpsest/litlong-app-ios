Some years after, Mr. Gilbert Burns was induced to migrate to East Lothian, by an offer from a son of Mrs. Dunlop, who wished him to take charge of his farm of Morham Mains, near Haddington. When Mr. Dunlop, some time after, sold this property, Gilbert accepted an appointment from Lady Blantyre to be land-steward or factor upon her estate of Lethington, in the same county, to which place he accordingly removed.

Mrs. Dunlop was so much pleased with his services in these matters that, in 1800, she entrusted him with the charge of her farm of Morham Mains, in East Lothian, besides recommending him to Lord Blantyre to be his factor in the same count}'. He thus obtained a free house from Lord Blantyre, with a salary of ^100, afterwards raised to ,\u00a3140, per annum.    "}]
