When they approached the house, who should stand by the threshhold to interchange greetings  but Redheugh, who at once and earnestly demanded his daughter from his widowed sister, as he helped her from the pillion.

This made Elshieshiels ths more anxious about the fact, when he heard from Simon an inkling of the marriage of the Lady at Lindores, with his Laird.

For Magdalen Leslie almost  grudged her own felicity, while Zion was in the furnace ; and this had been a season of quiet for her parents, purchased, as I have said, by what was surmised a touch of lukewarmness, or some want of a fervent, fiery zeal, on the part of auld Redheugh. Yet was he a man of great w r eight among the friends of the cause, and highly respected ; and something was yielded to his gray hairs, which demanded ease and peace, and something more to the prudent policy of Lady Lochkeltie, who, from the time she had been handled by the Privy Council, was ever in deadly terror of fines, forfeitures, and pilnewinks.

They held on by by-paths on the side of the stream opposite to Randolph's Tower for, with every holm, and cleugh, and bush, and brake here, young Rutherfurd was familiar from the days when he had been a gatherer of hazel nuts and a fisher of minnows until they stood on the rocks over against its gloomy strength, now frowning in the moonlight.

He was naturally but overly happy and vogie to have ability to grant a passage to Redheugh and the voung lady ; but he would suffer no one else to enter the vessel, save, as it chanced, that singular Christian Judon Elliot, the guidman  of Elshieshiels, who, his brain being more and more infirm with what he had suffered, had taken a craze to make a pilgrimage  to Magus Muir, for, as he said, the refreshment of his spirit, in viewing the scene where righteous judgment had been executed, once more before he yielded up his soul.

Flinging his furred cloak over his gold-laced habit, that had never gone off his back after the debauch, he burst into the Privy Council chamber like a man possessed by the Evil One ; and, the Duke of York being again in presence, first swore a deadly revenge against the Laird of Redheugh of whose lands he demanded the instant forfeiture and a deeper and more burning hatred than that, set on fire of hell, which already raged in his veins against the Lord's people.
