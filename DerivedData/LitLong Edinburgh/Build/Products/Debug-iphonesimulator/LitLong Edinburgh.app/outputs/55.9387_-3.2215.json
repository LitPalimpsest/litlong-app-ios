[{"title":"Perthshire in bygone days","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/94906406","placename":"Tay Street","snippet":"The chain of unfortunate circumstances which suggested to the mind of Andrew Sharpe the composition of the ode I have referred to, was shortly this. In the year 1808, William Herdman, a handsome and well-conducted young tradesman, lived in a land of houses facing the river, which has been lately removed to make way for Tay Street, and on the opposite side dwelt Ellen Eankine, whose father was gardener at Bellwood. Frequently passing and repassing across the river, the two formed a fond mutual attachment, which was about to resolve itself into their becoming man and wife, when a misunderstanding of a very trivial nature arose between Herdman and Ellen's father, which became aggravated into a quarrel, and the young man, being too proud to submit, took revenge on all by enlisting in the 92nd Regiment, then under orders for foreign service.
