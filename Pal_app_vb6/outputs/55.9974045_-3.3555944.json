[{"title":"Memoir of James Wyld of Gilston, and his family","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/95743043","placename":"Dalmeny Park","snippet":"In front was the beautiful park of Wester Warriston, and behind, the drawing-room windows looked out on the Royal Botanic Gardens, and afforded a fine view of Edinburgh. The road in front led up to Edinburgh and down to the Firth of Forth, and crossing this westward was the picturesque road to Queensferry, passing by the Corstorphine Hills, Barnton, Dalmeny Park, and on to Hopetoun House. William and I have thus been close neighbours and friends from the time of his retirement, and we have also had constant intercourse with the Edinburgh section of the family, - Isabella, Marion and her family, Eliza and her lively and intellectual husband, Professor Blackie, and with our sister Augusta, George, Edward, and Janet having their occupations and residences in London.
