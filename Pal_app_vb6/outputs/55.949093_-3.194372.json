In the year 1673, a bell, which cost 1490 merks and 8 shillings Scots, was hung up in the steeple, and continued weekly to summon the parishioners to church till the great fire of 1824, when, after hanging till it was partly melted by the heat, it fell with a tremendous crash among the blazing ruins of the steeple.

The date of the view is ascertainable from the introduction of the Weigh House steeple, demolished by Cromwell in 1650, and the spire of the.Tron Church, which was completed about 1663, although the church was so far advanced in 1647 as to be used as a place of worship. The destruction of the greater part of the ancient Palace in the former year, affords further evidence of this view having been taken about that period, as it is represented with considerable accuracy as it stood previous to the fire.

A part of it was then fitted up as a Tennis Court for the favourite pastime of catchpel, and continued to be used for this purpose till the year 1649, when it was taken possession of by the Magistrates of Edinburgh, and converted into the Weigh House of the burgh. The locality retained the name of Bernard's Nook, derived from its occupation by the royal servitor; and that of Bernard Street, which is now conferred on the broad thoroughfare that leads eastward from the Shore, still preserves a memorial of the favourite ehamber-chield of James VI.
