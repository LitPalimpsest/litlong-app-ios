The time is comparatively not remote since the flat valley in which it- lies was traversed by a small clear brook, that, rising in the Hunter's Bog, and receiving minute accessions in its course from two very celebrated saints' wells, St Anthony's and St Margaret's, found its way to the sea, after sweeping past the old ruinous church, through the arid but fragrant wastes of the Figget Whins. Even so late as 1790, when the now gloomy mansion-house of Marionville, in its immediate neighbourhood, was the scene of the gayest private theatricals perhaps in Britain, and ere its possessor had gained for himself the name of the \" Fortunate Duellist,\" and become one of the most unhappy of men, Restalrig was an eminently pleasant suburban village, surrounded by rich gardens and cheerful fields.

Not only would it furnish a new point of interest to the Park, already so rich in these, but it would serve also to keep even St Margaret's itself more in remembrance than it can at present be, in its sunk and degraded condition. Of its interest as a piece of architecture, independent of its great antiquity, the reader may be enabled to judge from the following description by a very competent authority, Dr Daniel Wilson, author of \" The Pre-historic Annals of Scotland\" :    "},{"title":"Wilson's tales of the borders and of Scotland :","author":"Wilson, John Mackay","year":"1857-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t1dj5gr4s","placename":"St Margaret's","snippet":"On the leaders of the Manchester regiment the vengeance of the bloodthirsty law first fell. It was on the evening of the 14th of July, 1746, James Dawson sat in his prison; Fanny sat by his side, with her hand in his, and his parents were ready also, when the jailer entei-ed, and ordered him to prepare to hold himself in readiness for his trial, in the co\\irt-liousc at St Margaret's, Southwark, on the following day.
