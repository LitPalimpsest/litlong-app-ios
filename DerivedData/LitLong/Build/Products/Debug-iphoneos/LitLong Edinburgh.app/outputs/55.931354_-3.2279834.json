Thus, in the year 1529, a memorable erafor this sort of expeditious justice, James V., havingfirst committed to ward the Earl of Bothwell, theLords Home and Maxwell, the Lairds of Buccleuch,Fairnihirst, Johnstone, Polwarth, Dolphington, andother chiefs of clans, marched through the Borderswith about eight thousand men, and seizing uponthe chief leaders of the moss-troopers, who seemnot to have been aware that they had any reasonto expect harm at their sovereign's hands, executedthem without mercy. Besides the celebrated JohnieArmstrong of Gillnockie, to whom a considerablepart of the English frontier paid black-mail, or protection-money, the names of Piers Cockburn ofHenderland, Adam Scott of Tushielaw, called theKing of the Border, and other marauders of note,are recorded as having suffered on this occasion.1And although this, and other examples of severity,had the effect for the time, as the Scottish phraseis, of \" dantoning the thieves of the Borders, andmaking the rush-bush keep the cow,\" yet thiscourse not only deprived the kingdom of the assistance of many brave men, who were usually thefirst to endure or repel the brunt of invasion, butit also diminished the affections of those who remained ; and a curious and middle state of relationappears to have taken place between the Bordererson each side, who, as they were never at absolutepeace with each other during the cessation of national hostilities, seem,in like manner,to have shunned engaging in violent and sanguinary conflicts,even during the time of war.
