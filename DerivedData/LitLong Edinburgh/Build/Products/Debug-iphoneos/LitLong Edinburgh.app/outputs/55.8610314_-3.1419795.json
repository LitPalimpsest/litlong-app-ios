It was under this tree that Drummond was sitting when Ben Jonson, the ex-bricklayer, ended his pedestrian journey from London, undertaken in order to visit his brother poet and other friends, and accomplished on foot, in defiance of Bacon's hint, that he 'loved not to see Poesy go on other feet than poetical Dactylus and Spond\u00e6us.'
