It is many a long day since his bones were deposited in the churchyard of St Fillans ; and, as his son died far from Manchester, and the second generation located themselves in Scotland, there remains not even a tombstone in that great manufacturing town where the old man made his wealth, to tell that there once lived a person of that name, the richest individual in it : neither is the name inscribed in any tablet of the memory of the existing generation ; and even the town records mention him not, for he was too much bent on making money, to allow any part of his time to be devoted to the good of the public. Vet, though he wrought tlius assiduously to be forgotten, he did not altogether succeed ; for, if his generosity was not Btrong enough to be remembered in tlie second or third generation, his weaknesses were strong enough to endure for ages.
