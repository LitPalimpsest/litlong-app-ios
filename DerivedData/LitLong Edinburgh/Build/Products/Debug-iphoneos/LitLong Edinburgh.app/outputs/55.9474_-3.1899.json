In Peter Williamson's \"Edinburgh Directory\" of 1786-88, his address is given as Argyle Square \u2014 which is near the University, and which disappeared on the construction of Chambers Street \u2014 and this fact led to the inference that the meeting must have occurred in that place, as Burns was in Edinburgh during the winter of 1786-87. But Scott himself speaks of Ferguson as living in an insulated house some distance from the town (Argyle Square was almost in the heart of the city) ; in a biographical sketch of Ferguson, printed in \"The Transactions of the Edinburgh Royal Society\" (1861-64), the writer says he lived at that time \"in a suburb called the Sciennes ;\" Henry Cockburn in his \" Memorials \" says, \" Old Adam Ferguson lived just east of my father's house,\" which would point clearly to the neighborhood of the Sciennes ; and to crown all, Mr. Archibald Munro, in a letter to one of the Edin burgh papers published about ten years ago, says    "},{"title":"Greyfriars Bobby,","author":"Atkinson, Eleanor (Stackhouse)","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t0cv4c542","placename":"Chambers Street","snippet":"He would know nothing of the crowds to gather there on a public occasion, massing on the bridge, in Grey friars Place, in broad Chambers Street, and down Candlemakers Row the magistrates and Burgh council, professors and students from the University, soldiers from the Castle, the neighboring nobility in carriages, farmers and shepherds from the Pentlands, the Heriot laddies marching from the school, and the tenement children in holiday duddies all to honor the memory of a devoted little dog. He would know nothing of the military music and flowers, the prayer of the minister of Greyfriars auld kirk, the speech of the Lord Provost ; nothing of the happy tears of the Grand Leddy when a veil should fall    "},{"title":"Literary landmarks of Edinburgh,","author":"Hutton, Laurence","year":"1891-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=yale.39002085618974","placename":"Chambers Street","snippet":"Those lovers of Scott who love the inanimate things which Scott loved will find much Scott to interest them in Edinburgh ; for, with the exception of the house in which he was born, almost all of his homes and haunts in the metropolis are still to be seen there, and in very much the same state as that in which he saw them. A tablet upon the modern house No. 8 Chambers Street, between South Bridge Street and West Col lege Street, states that it was built upon the site of the birthplace of Sir Walter Scott. This stood at the head of College Wynd, described as \" a steep and straitened alley\" ascending from the Cowgate towards the southern side of the town.

Once properly wedged, and provided no one in the immediate neighbourhood is doing anything with any garlic (it is well to avoid the vestibules if one is squeamish in that particular) we lift our feet off the floor, tuck them into the tail of our overcoat, and remain blissfully suspended in midair from Chambers Street to Ninety-sixth. The pressure of our fellow-passengers, powerfully impinging upon the globular perimeter we spoke of, keeps us safely elevated above the floor.
