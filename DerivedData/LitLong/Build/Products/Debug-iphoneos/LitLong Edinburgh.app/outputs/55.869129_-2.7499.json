The Romance,entitled The Castles of Athlinand Dunbayne, whichshe then produced, gave, however, but moderateintimation of the author's eminent powers. Thescene is laid in Scodaud, during the dark ages,but without any attempt to trace either the peculiarmanners or scenery of the country ; aud although,in reading the work with that express purpose, wecan now trace some germs of that taste and talentfor the wild, romantic, and mysterious, which theauthoress afterwards employed with such effect, wecannot consider it, on the whole, as by any meansworthy of her pen.
