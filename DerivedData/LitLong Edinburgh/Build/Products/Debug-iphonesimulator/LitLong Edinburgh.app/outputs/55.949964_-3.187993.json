She was lodged in the Black Turnpike, the town house of the Provost, Sir Simon Preston.1 This ancient and most interesting building stood to the west of the Tron Church, occupying part of the ground now left vacant, as the entrance to Hunter Square, and the site of the corner house.

It may be true what is affirmed, that Queen Mary was lodged in it in the year 1567, but if part of the building is really so old, it is evident other parts are of a later date, for on the top of a door, the uppermost of the three entries to this edifice from Peebles Wynd, we observe the following inscription :    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Black Turnpike","snippet":"In the centre of the High Street, in front of the Black Turnpike, the ancient citadel of the Town-Guard cumbered the thoroughfare till near the close of last century,-protected by its ungainly utility from the destruction that befel many of the more valuable relies of antiquity. During Cromwell's impartial rule in Edinburgh, it formed the scene of many of his acts of \" guid discipline, causing drunkardis ryd the trie meir, with stoppis and muskettis tycd to thair leggis and feit, a paper on thair breist, and a drinking cap in thair handis.\"2 This obsolete instrument of punishment, the wooden mare, still remained at the end of the old Guard-house, when Kay, the Caricaturist, made his drawing of it immediately before its destruction.

This appears from an action brought by \" the Administrators of Heriot's Hospital, against Robert Hepburn of Bearford,\" in 1693,2 for \" a ground-annual out of the tenement called Robertsons Inn,\" and which at a subsequent date is styled, \" his tenement in Edinburgh called the Black Turnpike.\" The pursuers demanded the production of the original writs from the Bishop of Dunkeld, and it would appear from the arguments in defence, that the building had been conferred by the Bishop on two of his own illegitimate daughters, and so diverted from the pious objects of its first destination, perchance as a sort of compromise between heaven and earth, by which more effectually to secure the atonement he had in view for the errors of a licentious life.
