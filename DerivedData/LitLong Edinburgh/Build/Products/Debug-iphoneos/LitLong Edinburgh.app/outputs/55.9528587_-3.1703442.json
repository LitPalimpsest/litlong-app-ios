On reading which, he suddenly called for his coach, and, leaning on one of his attendants, and in great agitation, drove to the Palace of Holyrood House, from whence, next day, he set out for London.4    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Palace of Holyrood House","snippet":"In July 1687, the King wrote to the privy council \" that the Abbey Church was the chapel belonging to his Palace of Holyrood House, and that the Knights of the noble order of the Thistle, which he had now erected, could not meet in St Andrew's Church,1 being demolished in the rebellion, as they called our Reformation, and so it was necessary for them to have this church ; and the Provost of Edinburgh was ordained to see the keys of it given to them.\"2 Some opposition was made to this by the Bishop of Edinburgh, but it was agreed to with little difficulty, and the inhabitants of the Canongate, whose parish church it had been, were ordered to seek accommodation in Lady Yester's Church, till better could be provided. The Canongate Church was shortly afterwards built from funds that had been left by Thomas Moodie, a citizen of Edinburgh, for the purpose of providing an additional place of worship.

One of the conditions bound them to deliver up, for the King's sole use, the houses in their kirk-yard, occupied by the town ministers, which was accordingly done, and on the site of them the Parliament House, which still stands, (though recently entirely remodelled externally), was afterwards built.

The chief street, which is as fine as any in Europe, is built upon a long ridge which ascends, for about a mile, from the Palace of Holyrood House up to a strong castle which crowns the summit of a lofty rock. The Palace, which was the first place I visited, is in the form of a square.    "},{"title":"Story of Maurice Lestrange.

We passed close to the Palace of Holyrood House, a group of gloomy buildings, which lay in the shadow of a huge hill, above which the wintry moon appeared, hidden, from time to time, by driving clouds. Before us there was a long, steep street, paved with stones, on both sides of which the houses rose to an immense height, with projecting balconies and tall gables which seemed to overhang the pavement; innumerable windows sent forth gleams of light into the frosty air.
