With a sad presentiment of the future, the broken-hearted Monarch received on his death-bed the intelligence, that his Queen had given birth to a daughter in Linlithgow Palace, and exclaimed in the bitterness of his heart, \" It came with a lass, and it will go with a lass !\" \" Woe is me?\" exclaimed Henry VIII., when the news of the King's death reached the English Court, \" for I will never have any King in Scotland so set to me again, nor one whom I favoured so well V Yet the advantages that such an occurrence afforded were not lost sight of by that wiley Monarch. His recent success had placed a number of the Scottish nobility in his power, and these he now sought to secure to his interests, by granting them their freedom, and loading them with costly gifts.

It passes Coilantogle Ford, where Roderick Dhu, having chivalrously conducted Fitz James thus far in safety, according to promise, challenged him to mortal combat ; then goes through the land made famous by the exploits of Rob Roy ; then leaving the Highlands for the Lowlands, passes the famous Castle of Donne and Abbey Craig, with its monument to William Wallace ; next goes over the bridge of Allan and into Stirling, and alongside the ruins of Stirling Castle, the most famous castle of Scotland ; then over the battlefield of Bannockburn, the Bannock River being a peaceful brook running between gently-sloping green banks, with but enough water to cover its pebbly bed ; through Falkirk and by the ruins of Linlithgow Palace, into the ravine through Edinburgh, landing its passengers almost beneath the walls of Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood. The route ended amid the green and highly-cultivated fields of the rich and level country near Edinburgh, and the puny, hairy cattle of the Highlands were quickly exchanged for the fat ones of the Lowlands; whilst arriving in the modern Athens, and landing at the Waverley Bridge, I found that I had to unlearn the lessons taught me in school, for all the kilted and breeked Scots and people who ought to know were pronouncing the name of Edinburgh as if it was written Edinborough.
