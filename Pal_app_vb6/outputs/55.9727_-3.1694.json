Entering by a low and narrow archway immediately behind the buildings on the east side, and about half-way between Charlotte Street and Coatfield Lane, the visitor finds himself in a singular looking, irregular, little court, retaining unequivocal marks of former magnificence. A projecting staircase is thrust obliquely into the narrow space, and adapts itself to the irregular sides of the court by sundry corbels and recesses, such as form the most characteristic features of our old Scottish domestic architecture, and might almost seem to a fanciful imagination to have been produced as it jostled itself into the straitened site.
