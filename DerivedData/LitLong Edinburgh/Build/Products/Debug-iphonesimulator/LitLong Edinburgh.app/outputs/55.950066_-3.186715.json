The small quadrangle also is quite in character with the period assumed for the building; and at its north-west angle in Cant's Close, where a curiously carved fleur-de-lis surmounts the gable, a grotesque gurgoil of antique form serves as a gutter to the roof. Here, therefore, we may assign, with little hesitation, the residence of Andrew Durie, nominated by James V. to the Abbey of Melrose in the year 1526; and whose death, Knox assures us, was occasioned by the terror into which he was put on the memorable uproar on St Giles's day, 1558.

If the carrier who will deliver this to you do not find you at home, you will please send the book to his quarters; his name is Thomas Henderson, the Berwick carrier; he leaves town on the Thursdays, about the middle of the day; he puts up at James Henderson, stabler, betwixt the foot of Cant's Close and Blackfriar's Wynd. After you have done with these papers, please return them by the same carrier; but there is no hurry; on the contrary the longer you keep them, I shall still believe you are thinking the more seriously to execute what I desire of you.

The most interesting fact, however, brought out by these early titles, occurs in defining the boundaries of the property, wherein it is described as having \" the trans of the prebendaries of the kirk of Crightoun on the east pairt and oyr partes ;\" so that a considerable part of Cant's Close appears to have been occupied in early times by ecclesiastical buildings in connection with the church of Crichton, erected into a collegiate foundation, in 1449, by Sir Wm. Crichton, Lord High Chancellor of Scotland.2 Directly opposite to the site of this is another ecclesiastical edifice, the mansion of the Abbot of Melrose, which enters from Strichen's Close.    "}]
