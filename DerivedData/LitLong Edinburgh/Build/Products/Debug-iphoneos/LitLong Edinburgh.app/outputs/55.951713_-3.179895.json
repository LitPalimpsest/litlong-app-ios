The old Canongate Churchyard is noted for the graves of Adam Smith, Dugald David Allen, the artist, and Adam Ferguson, the poet.

As we stood together a few days afterwards, while they were smoothing the turf over John's remains in the Canongate Churchyard, the heavens, which had been dark and slaty, cleared up suddenly, and the midsummer sun shone forth in his strength. Scott, ever awake to the \" skiey influences,\" cast his eye along the overhanging line of the Calton Hill, with its gleaming walls and towers, and then turning to the grave again, \" I feel,\" he whispered in my ear, \" I feel as if there would be less sunshine for me from this day forth.\"    "},{"title":"Edinburgh,","author":"Masson, Rosaline Orme.","year":"1910-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=loc.ark:\/13960\/t6rx9s72m","placename":"Canongate Churchyard","snippet":"Down in the Canongate there is Moray House with its balcony where Argyle and the wedding-party stood to watch Montrose driven by ; there is Queensberry House, now the House of Refuge ; there is Whitehorse Close, a fine old close, still intact ; there is the Canongate Tolbooth, standing out into the street ; and lastly there is the Canongate Churchyard, where so many of Edinburgh's famous dead lie, and where Robert Burns knelt and kissed the earth above the unmarked grave of the poet Fergusson.

In the Canongate Churchyard, not a stone's- throw from St. John's Street, lies good Scottish dust in plenty ; but, in Mr. Fairfield's eyes, the chief interest of the place was owing to the fact that John Ballantyne was buried there, and Sir Walter had stood at the open grave with Lockhart at his side, and had whispered, as he marked the sun gleam on the walls and towers of the Calton Hill, \" I feel as if there would be less sunshine for me from this day forth \".

And it is touching to recollect that the only sign he left of himself in Edinburgh, where for the first time he learned what it was to mix in fine company and to feel the freedom of money in his pocket, from which he could afford a luxury, was to place a stone over the grave of Fergusson in the Canongate Churchyard, where he lay unknown. His application to the Kirk-Session for leave to do this is still kept upon the books--a curious interruption amid the minutes of church discipline and economics.    "}]
