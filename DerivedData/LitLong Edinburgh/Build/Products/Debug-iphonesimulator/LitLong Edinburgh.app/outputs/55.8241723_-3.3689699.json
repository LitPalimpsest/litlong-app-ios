About a mile south of this, near the entrance to Morton Hall, is the Hare Stane, (confounded by Maitland, p. 506, with the former.) Various stones in Gloucestershire and other districts of England hear the same name which an antiquarian friend suggests is probably derived from the Saxon Hdr, signifying slaughter, and therefore indicating the site of an ancient battle. About a mile to the south of this, a huge Druidical mass of Red Sandstone bears the name of the Buck Stane.

Between these is still seen the wide expanse of the Borough Moor, on which the fanciful eye of one familiar with the national history, will summon up the Scottish hosts marshalling for southern war ; as when the gallant Jameses looked forth from these same towers, and proudly beheld them gathering around the standard of \" the Ruddy Lion,\" pitched in the massive \" Bore Stane,\"2 still remaining at the Borough Moor Head.
