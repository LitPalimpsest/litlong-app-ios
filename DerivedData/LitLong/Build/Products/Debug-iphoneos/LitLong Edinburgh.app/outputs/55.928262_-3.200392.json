It is intended to put up the arms of Mr. Robinson and his brother in the centre compartments of the bay-windoAv of the Dining Hall, and to prepare by colored borders or otherAvise, all the AvindoAvs of the room for receiving the arms of other sounders; and as the chief memorial, and principal  application of the funds, it is intended to decorate the ends and sides of the room, Avhich are Avell suited for the purpose, with a Mural Painting, in monochrome, by EdAvard Armitage, Esq., A. R. A , having for its subject Henry Crabb Robinson, surroundedby many of his most distinguished literary and artistic friends. The aim Avill be to represent these distinguished persons rather as they may have been graA'en on Mr. Robinson's memory, and have presented themseh'es to him in his happiest reveries, than with reference to any chronological or local arrangement.
