Put up at the Abbey Hotel, immediately connected with Melrose Abbey by a door into the grounds, and had rooms assigned us which looked directly through the nave to the fine eastern window of the chancel. We went at once into the abbey and wandered among its ruins until dusk, and later sat long, looking from our windows on the beautiful eastern window, revealed in the full light of the rising moon.
