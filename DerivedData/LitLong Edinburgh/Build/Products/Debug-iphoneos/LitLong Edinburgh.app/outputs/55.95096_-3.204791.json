It will be published soon, i.e., in a month or two, in the volume to be issued by the University Club, but separate copies will also be printed ; in truth, it is a College law, that if a Thesis be printed, so many copies (forty or seventy) must be sent to the University.

I never took in that Principal Cunningham had grown old till on Wednesday, May 24, 1893, I walked with him from the University Club at Edinburgh, where we were abiding, to the Conclave about which there used to be a preposterous reticence.

Their passions grew with their progress, and in St. James Street they wrecked the University Club, which had expelled Hyndman, one of their leaders, from its society. They seized certain carriages, turning out the ladies they contained, and stripped a footman of his livery.

The last pages were written in the University Club at Edinburgh, after returning from the little Conclave which nominated Dr. Marshall Lang for Moderator. Awful blasts of drenching rain battered the window of my little room ; and it was pitchy dark.    "}]
