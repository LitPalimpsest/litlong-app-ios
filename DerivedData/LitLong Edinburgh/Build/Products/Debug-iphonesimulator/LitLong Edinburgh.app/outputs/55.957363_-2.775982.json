In 1572, Mr Henry Killigrew, the ambassador of Queen Elizabeth, arrived at Edinburgh to congratulate the Earl of Morton on his accession to the Regency,2 when he \" depairtit to Dauid Forrestaris lugeing abone the tolbuith,\"3 in the same neighbourhood as the mansion in Old Bank Close, soon afterward occupied by Sir William Durie. So long as Edinburgh continued to be the seat of the Scottish Parliament, its vicinity to the Parliament House made the Lawnmarket be selected as a favourite place of residence, as appears from numerous passing allusions to the old nobility, though the particular houses referred to cannot now be traced.

On an upright tablet, at the west end, is the ingenious emblem of the resurrection referred to in the description of an edifice in the Old Bank Close which was similarly adorned.

The Bank of Scotland, or, as it was more generally styled by our ancestors, the Old Bank, continued to carry on all its business there, within the narrow alley that bore its name, until the completion of the extensive erection in Bank Street, whither it removed in 1805. The house bore the date 1588, the same year as that of the royal mandates authorising its erection, and on an upright stone panel, on its north front, a device was sculptured representing several stalks of wheat growing out of bones, with the motto, SPES ALTERA VIT\u00c6.

This was the Robert Gourlay who built the noble tenement in the Old Bank Close ; and through his official functions it came into connection with an interesting historical event. In May 1581, when the ex-Regent Morton was brought to Edinburg'h to suffer death, he was \u2014 as we learn from the memoirs of Moyses, a contemporary \u2014 ' lodged in Robert Gourlay's house, and there keeped by the waged men.'

Over the doorway of an ancient stone land in Gosford's Close, which stood immediately to the east of the Old Bank Close, there existed a curious sculptured lintel, containing a representation of the crucifixion, and which may, with every probability, be regarded as another relic of the abbot's house that once occupied its site. We furnish a view of this building as it latterly existed, with numerous additions of various dates and styles, that tended to increase the picturesqueness of the whole.

But all other objects of attraction to the local historian, within this district, must yield before those of the Old Bank Close, the site of which was very nearly that of the present paving of Melbourne Place. The antique mansion that formed the chief building in this close, excited very great and general attention from the time that it was exposed to view in opening up the approach to George Fourth s Bridge, until its demolition in 1834, to make way for the central buildings of Melbourne Place, that now occupy its site.
