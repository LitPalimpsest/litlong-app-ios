The surroundings of Edinburgh are very lovely, andthere are many interesting places within easy distance worth seeing,such as Leith, Trinity, and Newhaven, celebrated for their fish and fishwives, who have a picturesque costume like the Stirling women\u2014astriped skirt and large blue cloak, with a creel of fish on their backs,and a peculiar cry of \" Caller rue! caller haddy!\" Also Granton,Portobello, Musselburgh, Roslin (where is the famous Roslin Chapel),and Hawthornden, Dalkeith, Newbattle Abbey, Dalhousie Castle, Hopetown House, and Queensferry. Having spent a very happy time in Edinburgh, where I madepersonal friends of Sir James Symes, Professor Bennett, and Christison(at whose houses I dined and spent some pleasant evenings), and withthe family of Dr. Watson, it was with regret I said farewell to the oldUniversity, where I had passed some very pleasant days in taking myM.D. at the hands of Sir David Brewster, who placed a large cap\u2014called \u00c6sculapius' cap\u2014on my head, and with a few words pronouncedme Doctor of Medicine, I being attired in academical costume.

All along the route we pass places, points and spots of historic interest, as we believe every inch of Scottish soil is historic at any rate.

We drove to Dalhousie Castle, where the gallant Earl, who had done so much to distinguish the British name in all and every quarter of the globe, is repairing the castle of his ancestors, which of yore stood a siege against John of Gaunt. I was Lord Dalhousie's companion at school, where he was as much beloved by his companions as he has been ever respected by his companions-in-arms, and the people over whom he has been deputed to exercise the authority of his sovereign.
