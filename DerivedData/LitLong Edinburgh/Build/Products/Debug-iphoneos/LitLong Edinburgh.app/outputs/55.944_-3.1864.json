Our route to church was a lane called Windmill Lane, which had many stables in it; this lane is bisected by a cross street called Windmill Street, at the eastern end whereof there is a junction of several streets, of which the narrowest and dingiest is the Potterrow. At the top of the Potterrow is a lane at the back of the College, which led to another lane called the Horse Wynd, which descended to the Cowgate.

On the east side of George Square lies Windmill Street, the name of which preserves the record of an earlier period when a wind-mill occupied its site, and raised the water from the Borough Loch to supply the brewers of the Society. The Incorporation of Brewers has long been dissolved, and the Borough Loch now forms the rich pasturage, and the shady walks of the Meadows; while along its once marshy margin has since been built Buccleuch Place, where the exclusive fashionables of the southern district long maintained their own ball-room and assemblies.

He was followed to the grave (in the Chapel of Ease near Windmill Street) by many eminent and grateful pupils.
