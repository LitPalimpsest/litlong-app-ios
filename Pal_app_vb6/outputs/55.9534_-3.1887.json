What is now a level road, Waterloo Place, once looked down on a valley, with a cemetery and the Calton Hill beyond it.

I was descending the hill, past that spot on the Southern side, between the London Road and Waterloo Place, where the noble pile of the Royal High-School now marks the site once occupied by the Kirk of Fieid (or Church in the Fields) in which Queen Mary's worthless husband, Darnley, was blown up and murdered in February, 1567 ;\u2014past the handsome little Burns Monument, a pillared Grecian temple on base, with winged griffins supporting an hour-glass ;\u2014past the Prison of Edinboro', embattled with more than forty turrets, and notably handsome (to those who only see it from the outside .')\u2014when I saw something fluttering up the flagstaff Jo. the Royal Hotel, down Prince's Street, and recognized, for the first time in weeks, the starry flag which had so lately been raised anew over the last strong-hold of rebellion !

To her the nights in Waterloo Place were all too short; the days too long, too long for anything. The heavy, lumbering steps of a policeman at last broke her reverie.
