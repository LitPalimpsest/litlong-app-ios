It commands a point of the Forth, which was long the main passage from the Lowlands to the Highlands, and because of its great strategic importance, was probably an important military station, even in ancient Caledonian times, during the Roman occupation, and during the later conflicts between the Scots and the Picts, and has .figured more or less as the capital of Scotland, from the time of Malcolm Canmore till that of King James VI., and has participated so largely in the turmoil of national strife, both martial and political, as late as the two rebellions of the eighteenth century, that if we estimate it by its importance and prominence in Scotch history, it can be regarded with an interest secondary to Edinboro', with which, in fact, it has many features in common, being, like that city, partly ancient and partly modern, having modern villas, and wide streets intercepted with antique dwellings and narrow and ill conditioned thoroughfares.
