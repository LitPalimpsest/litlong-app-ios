To avoid the infection, the two young ladies built themselves a bower in a very retired and romantic spot called the Burnbraes, about three quarters if a mile westward from Lynedoch House, where they resided for some time, supplied with food, it is said, by a young gentleman of Perth, who was in love with them both. The disease was unfortunately communicated to them by their lover, and proved fatal, when, according to custom in cases of the plague, they were not buried in the ordinary parochial place of sepultm-e, but in a sequestered spot called Dronach Haugh, at the foot of a brae of the same name, upon the banks of the river Almond.
