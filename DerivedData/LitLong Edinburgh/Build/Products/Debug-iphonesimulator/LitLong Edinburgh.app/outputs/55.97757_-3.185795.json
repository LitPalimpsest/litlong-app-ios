The chief gate of the town was St Anthony's Port, where the walls intersected the Kirkgate ; and beyond this point no vestige of them has remained since the middle of the sixteenth century, although they extended thence to the river, and were continued on the opposite side, so as to enclose the more modern suburb that formed the nucleus of North Leith. No sooner was the treaty concluded which put an end to the siege of Leith, in 1560, than the fortifications that had been reared with so much labour and skill were ordered to be razed to the ground; the Council of the kingdom and the Magistrates of Edinburgh being too keenly impressed with a sense of their mischievous effects in the hands of an enemy, to appreciate the value of a stronghold as one of the keys of the kingdom, which had baffled the united forces of England and Scotland to compel its surrender.

One year's rent, however, had to be expended in repairs; and ere the next year passed, the heritors of the parish were rated for the erection of the magnificent parish church of North Leith, then in course of building, with its tall and graceful spire and classic portico ; and as we had no one to state our case, our house was rated, not according to its reduced, but according to its original value. And so the entire rental of the second year, with several pounds additional which I had to subtract from my hard-earned savings as a mason, were appropriated in behalf of the ecclesiastical Establishment of the country, by the builders of the church and spire.

This interesting and highly ornamental portion of the ancient monastic buildings was, in all probability, the work of the good Abbot Ballantyne, who rebuilt the north side of the church in the highly ornate style of his time, about 1490, and erected the chapel of St Ninian, North Leith, and the old stone bridge that led to it, which was demolished in 1789 to make way for the present upper draw-bridge. Adjoining this ancient porch, formerly stood Abbot Ballantyne's \" great house or lodging, with the yard thereof, lying beside the port of Holyrood House, on the north side of the street.\"    "},{"title":"Autobiographical reminiscences of David Johnston :","author":"Johnston, David","year":"1885-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uiuo.ark:\/13960\/t4dn42d2v","placename":"North Leith","snippet":"The master-gunnership of Leith sort was the first fruits of the Duke's favors, and this was rendered the more agreeable by the residence in that sort of his brother-in-law, David Davidson, and his delightful family.

He has taken Edgar as his authority for the Old Town ; South Leith from a survey by Wood in 1777 ; the intervening ground, including North Leith and the site of the New Town from a survey made in 1759, by John Fergus and Robert Robinson ; and the south of Edinburgh, including the whole ground to the Pow Burn, from another made the same year by John Scott.

An anecdote is told of Dr. Johnstone, once the minister of North Leith, who had rebuked a Newhaven fisherman, Adam Lucksie by name, for his ignorance in scriptural matters. Adam promised amendment, and the minister left a catechism for the joint benefit of Mr. and Mrs. Lucksie.

The foundation of the new parish church of North Leith had been laid so early as 1814, and at length in 1826 its venerable predecessor was finally abandoned as a place of worship, and soon after converted into a granary. \" Thus,\" says the historian of Leith, with indignant pathos, \" that edifice which had for upwards of 330 years been devoted to the sacred purposes of religion, is now the unhallowed repository of pease and barley!\"    "},{"title":"Waverley Novels.
