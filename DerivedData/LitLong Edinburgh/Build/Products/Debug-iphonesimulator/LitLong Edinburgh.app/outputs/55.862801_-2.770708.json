[{"title":"Arniston memoirs","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/95163602","placename":"Witches Knowe","snippet":"About the year 1756 my father planted up the small park called at that time the Rawmuir, west of the Hunter's Park, which now forms part of the high wood, and the lower division of which is thriving timber. At the upper end, next the Castleton march, an old earthen mound and ditch still remaining, there was a long belt of Scots fir planted by my grandfather which ran from the top of the Diamond eastward as far as the Witches Knowe. I remember these trees when I was a boy ; my father cut them all down about the year 1768.    "}]
