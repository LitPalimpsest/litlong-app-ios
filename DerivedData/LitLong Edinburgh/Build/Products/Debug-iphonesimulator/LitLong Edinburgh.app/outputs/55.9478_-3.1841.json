She could read fluently, and as they had wandered down by Drummond Street to the Pleasance, she soon made out the sign of John Gilpie, licensed broker, and at once entered the shop and opened up her business. The hideous face of the miser frightened her, as it had often frightened those of older growth; but the thought of Billy nerved her on, and she managed to make her shaking hands undo the locket, and placed it in his hands with the words\u2014 \" If you please, sir, will you buy that ? \" \" Can't buy it from you\u2014not allowed to buy from children,\" he snarled, with a look that curdled her blood.

The clock at Mistress Craven's was set ten minutes fast, so as to leave us time to flee down the Pleasance, dodge through a side alley, cut Simon's Square diagonally, debouch upon Drummond Street (shunning Rutherford's change-house, with its \"kittle\" step down into the cellar), and lo! there, big, barren, grey, grave, cauldrife as a Scots winter, was the College of King James--with the bell, unheard in the side-streets, fairly \"gollying\" at us--an appalling volume of sound--yet one which, on the whole, we minded less than the skirl and rasp of Mistress Craven's family clock.

I hustled through at once, and the moment M'Sweeny's eyes lighted on my face, he uttered a shout of delight that might have been heard down at the Tron Kirk.
