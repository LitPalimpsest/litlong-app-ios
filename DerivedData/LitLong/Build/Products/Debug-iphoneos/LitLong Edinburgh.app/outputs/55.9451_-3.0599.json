Many persons of consequence lived here : Lord Kames in a neat house at the top, on the east side \u2014 an edifice once thought so fine, that people used to bring their country cousins to see it ; Lord Hailes, in a house more than half-way down, now occupied by Mr Ruthven, mechanist ; Sir Philip Ainslie in another house in the same row.

Even those modern districts connected with it, as St John Street, New Street, George Square, &c. were beginning to be forsaken for the sake of more elegantly-circumstanced habitations beyond the North Loch. Into the remote social consequences of this change it is not my purpose to enter, beyond the bare remark, that it was only too accordant with that tendency of our pi*esent  form of civilisation to separate the high from the low, the intelligent from the ignorant \u2014 that dissociation, in short, which would in itself run nigh to be a condemnation of all progress, if we were not allowed to suppose that better forms of civilisation are realisable.

He had a mean lodging at the bottom of New Street in the Canongate, near the scene of the murder of Begbie, and to which it is remarkable that Leith Wi\/nd was the readiest as well as most private access from that spot. No suspicion, however, fell upon Mackoull at this period, and he left the country for a number of years, at the end of which time he visited Glasgow, and there effected a robbery of one of the banks.
