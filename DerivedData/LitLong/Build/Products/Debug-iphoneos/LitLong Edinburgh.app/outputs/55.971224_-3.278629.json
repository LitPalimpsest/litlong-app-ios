Shortly after leaving Granton, may be seen on the same side Lauriston Castle, formerly the property of John Law, the projector of the Slississippi scheme. On the north shore is the village of Aberdour, and Aberdour House, the seat of the Earl of Morton, and from which his eldest son takes the title of Lord Aberdour; near it are the ruins of an old castle.
