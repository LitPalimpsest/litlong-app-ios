So much interest, indeed, did the worthy Baronet take in Donald, that he never arrived at Cramond, to make his annual delivery of sheep, that Sir John did not send for him, in order that he might have a talk with him ; after which he always gave orders that every care should be taken of him, and every kindness  shown to him in the servants' hall, whilst he remained there ; and finally, it was ever his wont to dismiss him with some peculiar mark of his approbation. Donald's journey to Cramond, therefore, was always regarded by himself with very pleasing  anticipation for many a long day before the time of his departure arrived ; and when it did come, he turned out for the purpose of assuming the command of his flock, with his collies at his heels, with all the pride of a general attended by his staff, dressed in his best bonnet and plaid, kilt, hose, and brogues, with his best badger- snouted sporran, or purse, girt before him, and with his skian-dhu, or black-hasted knife, sticking in his belt.
