The son of a country shoemaker, he began the work of life at seven years of age as a herd-boy. Afterwards  he learned his father's trade, and worked at it for some time. But from childhood onward he took advantage of the few opportunities his circumstances provided for improving his mind. In this sturdy en- de-ivour to educate himself he was assisted by his own mother and by the mother of Joanna Baillie. In 1804 ho published his principal poem, The Poor Man's Sab- bith. which gave him some reputation. He was subsequently  employed by a Glasgow publishing firm, and edited various historical and poetical works, besides acting as corrector of proofs for the press. He wrote essays biographical and social which have not been published in a collected form and maintained his claim to be identified as a poet by the production of occasional verses. At the age of seventy four he was obliged to resume his original craft, and earn a livelihood by shoemaking. The efforts of a few private friends helped to relieve his latter years of the most pressing difficulties.  His memory is worth preserving as that of a representative of the best class of the Scottish peasantry,  and as that of a poet who has left us some valuable  pictures of national life.]    "},{"title":"The journal of Sir Walter Scott,","author":"Scott, Walter","year":"1891-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t7jq0vz0t","placename":"Lanark","snippet":"Breakfasted  at Lanark with the Lockharts, and reached Abbotsford this evening by nine o'clock.
