Formerly, the houses which line these closes were occupied by persons of distinction, and many of them bear to the present day the names of ancient families, such, for example, as \" Morrison's Close\"\u2014\" Grey's Close\"\u2014'\u2022' Stewart's Close\"\u2014and \" Blyth's Close.\" Gentlemen built themselves up, intentionally, in these confined spaces, for greater security, and that they might the better barricade their streets.
