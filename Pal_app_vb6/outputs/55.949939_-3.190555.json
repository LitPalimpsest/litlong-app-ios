The wags of last century, used to tell of a certain city treasurer, who, on being applied to for a new rope to the Tron Kirk bell, summoned the council to deliberate on the demand ; an adjournment to Clerihugh's tavern it was hoped might facilitate the settlement of so weighty a matter, but one dinner proved insufficient, and it was not till they had finished their third banquet in Writers' Court, that the application was referred to a committee of councillors, who spliced the old bell rope, and settled the bill!1    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Writers' Court","snippet":"On a certain noted Saturday night, in the annals of fiction, Dandy Dinmont and Colonel Mannering turned from the High Street \" into a dark alley, then up a dark stair, and into an open door.\" The alley was Writers' Court, and the door that of Clerihugh's tavern ; a celebrated place of convivial resort during the last century, which still stands at the bottom of the court, though its deserted walls no longer ring with the revelry of High Jinks, and such royal mummings as formed the sport of Pleydell and his associates on that jovial night. The picture is no doubt a true one of scenes familiar to grave citizens of former generations.

Blair, a young man living in Writers' Court, of whom we can say little more than that he was connected \\yth the Borgue family in the Stewartry, an advocate, and also married.

On reaching the house, where he was admitted upon the instant, he found a counterpart of his own domestic tragedy \u2014 everything telling the tale of weariness, anxiety, and fear ; comers and goers with lugubrious countenances ; and Mrs Blair herself in a chair    "},{"title":"Tales of a Grandfather ...

This dignitary was quietly seated in a well-known tavern (afterwards Walker's, in Writers' Court,) when a tremendous clatter on the street announced the arrival of the dragoons, or a part of them, in this disorderly condition. The stout old commander presented himself before them, with a pistol in his hand, and summoned them to surrender to his Royal Highness's mercy.

The characters in the novels were, for the time being, as real to him as was Scott himself ; and he seemed as well pleased to follow Colonel Mannering and Dandie Dinmont in their progress to the tavern in Writers' Court where they caught Pleydell at high jinks, as he was to follow Sir Walter in his strolls home from the Parliament House or his favourite walk under the Salisbury Crags. When we were in the Canongate together, he could never resist the temptation to turn down St. John's Street to have one more look at James Ballantyne's house ; and as he stood before Number 10 in a brown study, I felt no doubt that in imagination he was taking part in one of those gorgeous dinners, which heralded the appearance of a new Waverley novel, and which Lockhart describes with such good-humoured contempt.
