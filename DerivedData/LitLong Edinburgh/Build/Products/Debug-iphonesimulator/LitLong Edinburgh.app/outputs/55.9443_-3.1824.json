By recent improvements it has been made part of a street, connecting old Davie Street with new Howden Street, running between West Richmond Street and Crosscauseway. A much humbler locality this than that of Alison Square close at hand, but now similarly obliterated almost out of recognition, and named Marshall Street, in which Thomas Campbell, ten winters before, in a ' dusky lodging,' wrote the ' Pleasures of Hope.'
