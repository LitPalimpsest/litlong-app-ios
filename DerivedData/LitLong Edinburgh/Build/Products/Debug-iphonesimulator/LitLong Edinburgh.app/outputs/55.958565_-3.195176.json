On this particular morning, though,  be-sandalled Hermes smiled upon him: a few days earlier  Angus had written to Antonia, and now here was a letter  addressed to Angus Lordie DA (Edin), Drummond Place,  Edinburgh, Scozia. Angus smiled at the formal inclusion of  his ancient qualification; that was Italy already exerting its  influence on Antonia \u2013 the Italians were punctilious about  titles, with any graduate, or indeed anybody who wore  glasses, being accorded the title dottore; while a professor  was Chiarissimo (most renowned one) or, if the dean of a  faculty, Amplissimo (most ample one).

The day after the fortuitous encounter of the two boys in their newly-established meeting place in Drummond Place Gardens, Bertie found a neatlywrapped parcel in Aitken and Niven livery waiting for him under the appointed bush. He had obtained leave from Irene to go out and play in the gardens for fifteen minutes or so prior to his yoga class in Stockbridge, and had used the time to locate the parcel.    "},{"title":"Bertie Plays the Blues","author":"McCall Smith, Alexander","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.alexandermccallsmith.co.uk","placename":"Drummond Place","snippet":"His lukewarm response was the result of his unwillingness  to abandon his flat and studio in Drummond Place \u2013  something he thought would be necessary if they were to  buy out Antonia. It was all very well for Domenica to reassure  him that he would be able to paint just as well in  Scotland Street \u2013 she did not understand that an artist  needed space to work properly, and space was a question  of ceiling height as much as it was one of the length and  breadth of a room.    "},{"title":"Espresso Tales","author":"McCall Smith, Alexander","year":null,"url":null,"placename":"Drummond Place","snippet":"It was these complex thoughts that were in the forefront of Irene's mind when she collected Bertie that afternoon and brought him back to Scotland Street. Bertie seemed silent on the 23 bus as they made their way home, and this silence continued as they walked back along Cumberland Street and round the corner into Drummond Place. Irene, however, still busy thinking about Kleinian matters, did not notice this and only became aware of the fact that something was on Bertie's mind when he came to her in her study and presented her with the crumpled piece of card that he had extracted from the pocket of his dungarees.

He understood that his place was with his  master \u2013 wherever Angus might be \u2013 but he could not fathom  the reason why, instead of walking back round the corner  to Drummond Place at the end of a visit, as they always  had done, they should stay for such long periods in Scotland  Street. And then there was Domenica to contend with: Cyril  had been aware of her disapproval, at least in the early days  of their relationship, but had been pleased when she began to  show first acceptance and then affection.    "},{"title":"44 Scotland Street","author":"McCall Smith, Alexander","year":null,"url":null,"placename":"Drummond Place","snippet":"The door was somewhat shabby, needing a coat of paint to cover the places where the paintwork had been scratched or chipped away. Well, this was Scotland Street, not Moray Place or Doune Terrace; not even Drummond Place, the handsome square from which Scotland Street descended in a steep slope. This street was on the edge of the Bohemian part of the Edinburgh New Town, the part where lawyers and accountants were outnumbered \u2013 just \u2013 by others.

And if Angus did not wish to sell Drummond Place, it would  still be possible to buy Antonia's flat by realising some  investments of her own. It would not be the best place for  the money, as it would provide no income, but the investments  in question showed no signs of doing that anyway  and would not be missed if they were to be transformed  into bricks and mortar \u2013 or, in the case of Scotland Street,  into stone and pointing.

Unlike most New Town  streets, which ran in a straight line or, at most, followed a leisurely curve, Nelson Street had a zigzag where it was interrupted at a right angle by another street; Alex lived in the zag, just before it opened out on to the broad square of Drummond  Place.

Both Domenica and Angus were owners of  the flats in which they lived: Domenica's flat being in 44  Scotland Street, directly above the Pollock family, and  Angus's being several hundred yards away in Drummond  Place.
