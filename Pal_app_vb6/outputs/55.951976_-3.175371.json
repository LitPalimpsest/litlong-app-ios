It need not be wondered at, that an alliance proposed in so very different a manner from the last, was promptly acceded to by the Scottish Parliament. The Earl of Huntly, it is said, when desired to use his influence in favour of the marriage with Edward VI., after he had been taken prisoner, replied, that however he might like the match, he liked not the manner of wooing !2 Shortly after, Monsieur Villegagnon, set sail with four gallies from Leith, and passing round the north of Scotland, received the youthful Queen on board at Dumbarton.
