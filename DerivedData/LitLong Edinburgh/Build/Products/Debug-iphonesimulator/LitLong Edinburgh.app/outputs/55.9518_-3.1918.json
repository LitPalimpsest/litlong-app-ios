The tallest of these lands, as they are locally termed, have long since been burnt out ; but to this day it is not uncommon to see eight or ten windows at a flight ; and the cliff of building which hangs imminent over Waverley Bridge would still put many natural precipices to shame. The cellars are already high above the gazer's head, planted on the steep hill-side ; as for the garret, all the furniture may be in the pawnshop , but it commands a famous prospect to the Highland hills.
