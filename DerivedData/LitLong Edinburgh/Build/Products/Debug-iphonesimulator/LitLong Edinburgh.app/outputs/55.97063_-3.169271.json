The building of St Andrew's Church on its present site was suggested at a later peiiod, as an appropriate counterpoise to the Physicians' Hall, erected in 1775. We are not aware if any of the competing plans for the extended royalty are now in existence, but one is led to wonder wherein their shortcomings and errors consisted, that the plan of James Craig was judged so eminently superior.

The Canongate Church was shortly afterwards built from funds that had been left by Thomas Moodie, a citizen of Edinburgh, for the purpose of providing an additional place of worship.

St Andrew's Church appears as occupying the Bite originally intended for it, on the open ground in front of the mansion afterwards built by Sir Laurence Dunda6, on the east side of St Andrew Square, and now occupied as the Royal Bank of Scotland. It was designed, in accordance with the studied regularity of the whole plan, to form a counterpart to St George's Church in Charlotte Square, or St George's Square, as it was named before the rival extension over the southern districts pre-occupied the term.
