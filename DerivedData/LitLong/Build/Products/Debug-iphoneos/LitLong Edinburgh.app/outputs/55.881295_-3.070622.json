The surroundings of Edinburgh are very lovely, andthere are many interesting places within easy distance worth seeing,such as Leith, Trinity, and Newhaven, celebrated for their fish and fishwives, who have a picturesque costume like the Stirling women\u2014astriped skirt and large blue cloak, with a creel of fish on their backs,and a peculiar cry of \" Caller rue! caller haddy!\" Also Granton,Portobello, Musselburgh, Roslin (where is the famous Roslin Chapel),and Hawthornden, Dalkeith, Newbattle Abbey, Dalhousie Castle, Hopetown House, and Queensferry. Having spent a very happy time in Edinburgh, where I madepersonal friends of Sir James Symes, Professor Bennett, and Christison(at whose houses I dined and spent some pleasant evenings), and withthe family of Dr. Watson, it was with regret I said farewell to the oldUniversity, where I had passed some very pleasant days in taking myM.D. at the hands of Sir David Brewster, who placed a large cap\u2014called \u00c6sculapius' cap\u2014on my head, and with a few words pronouncedme Doctor of Medicine, I being attired in academical costume.
