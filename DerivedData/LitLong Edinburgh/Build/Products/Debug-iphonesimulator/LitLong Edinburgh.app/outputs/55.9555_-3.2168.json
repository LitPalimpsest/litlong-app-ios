[{"title":"Memoir of James Wyld of Gilston, and his family","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/95743043","placename":"Dean Park Crescent","snippet":"On coming home, in the summer of 1888, from Bordighera and Aix-les-Bains, where we had gone for the treatment of Mrs Wyld for rheumatism, and where our niece, Maggie Lewis, was with us also for treatment, we found nearly all our nearest kith and kin, from London and from Edinburgh, located in Kingussie, William and Louisa only remaining at home and near us. Marion also I found sitting quietly and alone in her comfortable, well ornamented drawing-room at Dean Park Crescent. She was perceptibly  thinner and paler, in fact older, but she was calmer, happier, and more tender ; no sharpness ; on the contrary, her love from time to time welled up, as we conversed, and it sometimes ended with a spontaneous wave of affection, and a brotherly and sisterly kiss.
