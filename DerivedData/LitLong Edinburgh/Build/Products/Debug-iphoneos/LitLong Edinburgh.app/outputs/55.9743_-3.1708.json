It was built by the citizens of Leith in the year 1565, though not without the strenuous opposition of their jealous over-lords of the Edinburgh Council, who threw every impediment in their way; untd at length Queen Mary, after repeated remonstrances, wrote to the Provost and Magistrates:\u2014\" We charge zow that ze permit oure Inhabitants of oure said toun of Leith, to big and edifie oure said Hous of Justice, within oure said Toun of Leith, and mak na stop nor impediment to thame to do the samyn, for it is oure will that the samyn be biggit, and that ze disist fra further molest-    "},{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Tolbooth Wynd","snippet":"At the foot of the Tolbooth Wynd, the good Abbot Ballantyne, who presided over the Monastery of Holyrood during the closing years of the fifteenth century, caused a handsome stone bridge of three arches to be erected over the Water of Leith, and soon after its completion, he built and endowed a chapel at the north end of the bridge, and dedicated it to the honour of God, the Virgin Mary, and St Ninian.
