This work was largelydeveloped when in 1880 the congregation, at a cost ofbetween \u00a33000 and \u00a34000, acquired commodious andthoroughly suitable premises, the Halls in MarshallStreet. In these the various meetings connected withthe Congregation and Mission have been carried oncomfortably and with much success; and the Missionhas not only been blessed to many families in thedistrict, but has reacted in much blessing to the congregation itself, binding the membership togetherby common labour and association.
