Its last most celebrated Scottish players are said to have been James Hepburn, Esq. of Keith, and the famous John Law, of Laurieston, afterwards comptrollergeneral of the finances in France.3 The whole ground to the eastward of the Tennis Court appears in Edgar's map as open garden ground attached to the Palace, with the exception of the small building known as Queen Mary's Bath ; but shortly after Lord Adam Gordon, commander of the forces in Scotland, took up his residence at Holyrood Palace in 1789, he granted permission to several favourite veterans who had served under him abroad, to erect small booths and cottages along the garden wall; and they so effectually availed themselves of the privilege that several of the cottages have since risen to be substantial three and four storied lands. John Keith, a favourite subaltern, obtained at that time the piece of ground immediately adjoining Queen Mary's Bath, and in the course of rearing the large building, which now remains in the possession of his daughters, he had to demolish part of a turret stair-case which led to the roof of the Bath.
