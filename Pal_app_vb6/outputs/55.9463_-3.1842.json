At the west side of that court is a block or \" land \" of houses which are now rather worse than they were at the time of which I write, for a theatre has been built up against the back windows, almost shutting out the light of day from one side of the building.

We feasted on the satisfaction the tramps took in tlieir lunch, long after our own was concluded ; and, seeing them well off on their road again, took up our own way to Gad's Hill Place. How comfortable it looked on our return ; how beautifully the afternoon gleams of sunshine shone upon the holly -trees by the porch ; how we turned away from the door and went into the playground, where we bowled on the green turf, until the tall maid in her spotless cap was seen bringing the five-o'clock tea thitherward ; how the dews and the setting sun warned us at last we must prepare for dinner ; and how Dickens played longer and harder than any one of the company, scorning the idea of going in to tea at that hour, and beating his ball instead, quite the youngest of the company up to the last moment ! \u2014 all this returns with vivid distinctness as I write these inadequate words.
