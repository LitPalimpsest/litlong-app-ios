Henry Mackenzie first took up house for himself in the middle tenement, still standing on the south side, while the celebrated Lord Woodhouselee occupied one of those recently demolished. The middle house on the north side, a large and commodious mansion, still retains abundant traces of former grandeur, and chiefly in the large drawing-room on the first floor, which is decorated with a series of landscapes, interspersed with floral groups and other fancy devices, evidently in imitation of the painted chamber at Milton House, though the work of a less skilful artist. This was the residence of Sir Thomas Miller, of Barskimming and Glenlee, Bart., Lord President of the Court of Session, who died there in 1789.

Lord Fountainhall reports a dispute, in 1694, between the Trades of Canongate and the Earl of Roxburghe, in which the Lords declared his house in the Canongate free, and himself empowered, by right of certain clauses in a contract between the Earl, the Town of Edinburgh, and Heriot's Hospital, to employ artificers on his house who were not freemen of the burgh.1 Such contentions, originating in the jealousy of the Corporations of the Canongate, are of frequent occurrence at the period, and show with how despotic a spirit they were prepared to guard their exclusive rights.

Milton House, a handsome large mansion, built in the somewhat heavy style which was in use during the eighteenth century, derives its name from Andrew Fletcher of Milton, Lord Justice-Clerk of Scotland, who succeeded the celebrated Lord Fountainhall on the bench in the year 1724, and continued to preside as a judge of the Court of Session till his death in 1766. He was much esteemed for the mild and forbearing manner with which he exercised his authority as Lord Justice-Clerk after the Rebellion of 1745.    "}]
