A walk, littlefrequented save by strangers, winded around theverge of the precipitous hill, and showed, in pleasing succession, a noble view of the Forth, with themountains beyond it,\u2014of Leith, and its shipping,\u2014of Musselburgh Bay, and the fine eastern crescent of land, terminated so happily by North Berwick Law,\u2014of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags,with the towers of the old Palace, and its hugequadrangular court lying close under the eye ofthe spectator,\u2014of the massive and high-piled buildings of the Old Town, terminated by the Castle,and backed by the blue range of the PentlandHills,\u2014and, finally, as the spectator returned towards the point from which he set out, he commanded a view of the New Town, with the minarets of the Register House, and the grand archesof the North Bridge. The promenade, in its successive richness of beautiful objects, and the numerous moral associations which they are calculated toexcite, is perhaps unequalled in Europe, or in theworld.

The taper arch of Hiccory, from which a wooden grilse depends, ruralises the whole city from the Register House to the College.
