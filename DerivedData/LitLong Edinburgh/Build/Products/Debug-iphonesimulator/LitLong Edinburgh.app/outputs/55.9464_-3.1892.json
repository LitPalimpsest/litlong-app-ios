But when Mr Bruce left us not a stone had been built of our new church now called the Assembly Hall, and the congregation was told just to remain where it was in Brighton Street. Our parish was taken from us by the Tolbooth people, while the new one was not fixed for us for some time, so in addition to wanting minister, precentor, bedrell, and great part of the congregation, we were minus a parish also.

We continued there till the church was sold over our heads, and we found refuge in Dr Ritchie's church in the Potterrow in 1846, and were there till our new church in Forrest Road was opened in June 1848.

The Town Council had discovered that the rent paid for the Methodist Chapel was too high, and they hired for us a big cold chapel in Brighton Street, which was empty at the time. To this we shifted in 1836, and we did not like the change.

When the time of action came, and we had to leave the Establishment in May 1843, we went almost as a congregation, leaving the church in Brighton Street. We were hospitably entertained by the Independent Congregation in Argyle Square, the minister of which, Dr Alexander, and his people generously altering their hours of worship so as to share the day with us.

We were worshipping in Brighton Street, when he preached his first sermon after his restoration from the text, \"Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.\" During his illness we received most willing and much appreciated help from many of the best ministers of the church, which leads me to speak of the kind of assistance which Mr Brown drew to himself and his people.
