So Manie, seeing that the scent was hot and the game up, made confession, and saved further trouble, She said that eighteen years ago, the devil had come to her in likeness of a man, calling himself a physician, saying that he had good salves, and specially oylispek (oil of spike or spikenard), wherewith he would cure her daughter, then sick.
