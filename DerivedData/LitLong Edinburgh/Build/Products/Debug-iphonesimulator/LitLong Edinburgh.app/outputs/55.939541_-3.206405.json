An examination of these suffices to show that no dependance can be placed on the date referred to by Cadmon in fixing the age of the building, as the whole are in the florid style that prevailed in the reign of James VI., and were no doubt cut at one period as a durable memorial of the family tree.1 Maitland after refuting the popular derivation of the name of Wrychtishousis, from the supposed fact of the wrights or carpenters having dwelt there while cutting down the oaks of the Borough Muir, assigns it as the mansion of the Laird of Wryte.2 That however, is merely reasoning in a circle, and deriving its name from itself; but no better explanation seems now discoverable.

Their arms are quite distinct, until 1513\u2014the memorable year of Flodden,\u2014when one of the heraldic sculptures shows an alliance between the Laird of Wrychtishousis and a daughter of Merchiston.

The close intimacy between the Napiers of Merchiston and Wrychtishousis had been cemented by an alliance in 1513. Its continuation in the time of the philosopher is shown by an application from his neighbour for a seat or da* adjoining his in the Parish Church of St Cu.hbert, so that their possession of a common place of sepulture at the period of his death is extremely probable.

The general effect of this antique pile was greatly enhanced on approaching it by the numerous heraldic devices and inscriptions which adorned every window, doorway, and ornamental pinnacle ; the whole walls being crowded with armorial bearings, designed to perpetuate the memory of the noble alliances by which the family succession of the Napiers of Wrychtishousis had been continued from early times. The earliest records of this ancient family which have been discovered, show that William Napier the owner of the old mansion in 1390, was then Constable of Edinburgh Castle, and maintained that important stronghold at the beginning of the following century, with the aid of Archibald, Earl of Douglas, and the unfortunate Duke of Rothsay, against Henry IV., at the head of the whole military force of England.

To this brave resistance, which baffled all the efforts of the English monarch and redeemed Scotland from total subjection, the ingenious genealogist of the Napiers conceives that the peculiar tenure of the Wrychtishousis may be referred. From old charters preserved in the Register House it appears that that property was held by payment to the king of a silver penny upon the Castle Hill of Edinburgh.

Many readers will remember a quaint little Dutch manikin, with huge goggle eyes, and a bunch of flax in his hand, who presided over its threshold in latter times.    "}]
