One answer had been the Cumberland Bar, where he went several nights a week, or the Scottish Arts Club, where he met his artist friends and, from time to time, that sociable dentist who, after a party, had inserted Cyril's gold tooth. Another answer was that he had resorted to engaging himself in solitary conversation, a habit that he had now been obliged to break.

And when he went down to the Cumberland Bar to sit at his usual table and pass the time in conversation, Cyril would accompany him, lying under the table, guarding the small dish of beer which was his ration for the night. Cyril did not disagree with anything that Angus said or did; Cyril would wait for hours for the slightest acknowledgement of his presence by his master, wagging his tail with undisguised enthusiasm whenever his name was uttered.
