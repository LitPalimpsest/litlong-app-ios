Since that period, alarge opening has been made in the High Street,forming the access from the North Bridge; andcorresponding streets have been since opened fromthe South Bridge, and from Hunter's Square, thusinsulating the Tron Church, which formerly madea continued part of the southern line of the street. The utility of these avenues from the north andsouth is indisputable; and perhaps many may beof opinion that they improve even the externalappearance of the street, though this will hardlybe granted by those who recollect the stately andalmost sublime effect produced, when the lofty lineof houses on each side was entire and unbroken.
