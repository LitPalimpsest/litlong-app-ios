After some months in one corner of Marchmont, the area  of Edinburgh most popular with students \u2013 or with those  students who could afford to live like students \u2013 she had  moved to another corner of the same quarter, to a flat on  the top floor of a Victorian stone tenement in Warrender  Park Terrace, which snaked round the edge of the Bruntsfield  Links, an undulating urban golf course that had once been  part of an oak forest surrounding the town. The town had  consumed the oak forest and gone on to swallow the farmland  beyond, but the links and the Meadows remained,  green lungs serving the cobbled arteries and stone chambers  of the growing city.

It was not a formally constituted pecking order \u2013 only a society  with a fixed order of precedence will have such a thing formally  laid out, and in no society will the official order of precedence  represent the real order.

There were so many respects in which Pat, even though  only twenty-one, was a former something, but to list them all  would give the impression that her best years were behind her  and that she was now somewhat washed up; which was far from  being the case. In fact, as she strode purposefully across Middle  Meadow Walk, on her way back to her flat in Warrender Park  Terrace, she would have appeared to any passer-by to be anything  but finished. Indeed, such a passer-by would have thought that  this person was not a student at all \u2013 given the usually leisurely  gait of students walking across the Meadows \u2013 but a person with  a sense of wanting to get somewhere, even if that somewhere was  only Warrender Park Terrace.
