With my eyes thus grown familiar in the search, I was wearily trudging homewards late in the afternoon with the shawl nearly gone from my thoughts, when on the South Bridge, near the head of Infirmary Street, I came up to a wretchedly-clad woman bearing in her arms a child, round which was wrapped a gaudy and apparently new shawl of the exact pattern I sought. Now, at the first glimpse of this shawl I decided that it was not the one I sought, which I imagined would scarcely be so bright and fresh-looking; but it was the incongruity of that bright shawl, allied to such rags and poverty, which made me slacken my pace, and almost instinctively follow the owner of the child.

It was neither the great nor wealthy of the land that assembled to help by their presence the joy of the occasion, but a goodly com- pany of honest-hearted men and women, viz., a large nnmber of the pressmen and compositors of the King's Printing-House, and a few young girls, Diamond's late companions in the straw-hat manufactory on the South Bridge.

You stand on the South Bridge, and looking down, instead of a stream, you see the Cowgate, the dirtiest, narrowest, most densely peopled of Edinburgh streets. Admired once by a French ambassador at the court of one of the Jameses, and yet with certain traces of departed splendour, the Cowgate has fallen into the sere and yellow leaf of furniture brokers, second-hand jewellers, and ven-    "},{"title":"Brought to Bay; or, Experiences of a City Detective","author":"Macgovan, James.","year":"1878-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-002315194","placename":"South Bridge","snippet":"An idea had struck me, which, as I walked towards the place, seemed so simple and plausible, that I roundly abused myself for never thinking of it before. The South Bridge, as every one knows who has seen it, spans a valley stretching from High Street to Infirmary Street, but the only one of the massive stone arches visible is that which crosses the Cowgate. The others are built against by the houses on either side, and are mostly used by those occupying the lower flats in Blair Street, Niddry Street, etc., as a kind of large store-rooms or great cellars.

He seemed to regard all our talk about the old town and its associations as a great bore, and it was impossible to get him out of the snug parlor of the Royal Hotel, or beyond Princes Street or South Bridge, where he passed much of his time with his nose flattened against the plate-glass of the shop-windows, contemplating, in an ecstasy of delight, the brilliancy of their displays. He was especially enamored of the Scotch stuffs, and bought whole pieces of velvet, and rolls of ribbon of the plaid of a clan to which he professed to belong ; and in whose annals, traditions, associations, and especially costume, his entire interest, as far as Scotland was concerned, seemed absorbed.
