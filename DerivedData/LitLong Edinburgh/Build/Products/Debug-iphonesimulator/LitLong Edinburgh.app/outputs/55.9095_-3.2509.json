In the spring of i860, John Schetky began a large picture of Lord Rodney's action with the Comte de Grasse, the commission for which was given him by Mr John Penn, of The Cedars, Lee, in which he became greatly interested. It was a favourite subject with him and  he writes to his youngest daughter : - *' I am never seen from breakfast till lunchtime , and again from that till I can see no longer, being in my painting-room looking at the great battle of the 12th of April, while the contending fleets are coming in sight one by one from the point of my left-handed brush.\"    "}]
