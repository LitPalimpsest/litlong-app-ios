The western view embraces the estate of Fletcher, of Saltoun Hall, the bonny braes o' Branxholm, the estates of Seaton, of Caddell of Cockenzie, of Ormiston, and others, up to the boundary line west of Preston Grange, taking in the continued line of thriving villages along the coast, make up a landscape which, when once seen, never can be forgotten. From Gullen on the east, to Prestonpans on the west, presents one of the most thriving scenes of industry to be found anywhere.

It was proved that thirty-three score of sheep were found on Ormiston bearing Murdison's buist branded over, and, as far as possible, obliterating, the known buists of other farms. None of these sheep had been sold to the prisoners.    "},{"title":"Autobiography of the Rev.

There met accordingly in the tavern the Eight Honourable the Lord Provost Drummond ; the Honourable AVilliam Master of Ross ; Mr Gilbert Elliot, junior of Minto ; Mr Andrew Pringle, advocate ; Messrs' J ardine, Blair, Robertson, John Home, Adam Dickson of Dunse, George Logan of Ormiston, Alexander Carlyle of Inveresk, and as many more as made fifteen, two of whom \u2014 viz.

Therefore, when daylight began to appear, if the sheep had already been got well on their way towards Ormiston, Millar would leave \"Yarrow\" to finish the drive single-handed, a task which the dog always carried out most successfully if it could be done reasonably early, before people began to move abroad out of their houses. But as soon as the dog caught sight of strangers he would at once leave the sheep and run home by a circuitous route.

As they neared the farm-house a shepherd, leaning against an outbuilding, turned with a start at sight of them, slipped suddenly round a corner of the outhouse, and presently was seen, bent nearly double, in hot haste running for a field of standing corn.

The news arrived so critically, that it was with difficulty the messenger obtained entrance to the Castle; and even then the deputygovernor, disbelieving the intelligence, or secretly well affected to lhe cause of the Pretender, contented himself with directing the rounds and patrols to be made with peculiar care, and retired to rest.

Still, he hesitated to act in so ugly looking an affair, and it was only after long and painful consultation with a neighbour, himself of late a heavy loser, that Gibson went to Peebles in order to get the authority necessary to enable him to inspect the flocks on Ormiston.
