Stockbridge was one of those villages which, like Broughton, Canonmills, Silvermills (Henderson  Row), etc., have gradually been absorbed by the e.-ctension of the new town. It contains several elegantly built streets, such as St. Bernard's Crescent (built on the site of St. Bernards, the villa of Sir Henry Raeburn, the celebrated portrait painter), but from the locality being rather sunk, and too near the Water of Leith, the property has very much depreciated.
