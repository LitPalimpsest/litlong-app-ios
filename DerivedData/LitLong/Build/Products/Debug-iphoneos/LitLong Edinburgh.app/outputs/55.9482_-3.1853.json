With my eyes thus grown familiar inthe search, I was wearily trudging homewards late in theafternoon with the shawl nearly gone from my thoughts, whenon the South Bridge, near the head of Infirmary Street, I cameup to a wretchedly-clad woman bearing in her arms a child,round which was wrapped a gaudy and apparently new shawlof the exact pattern I sought. Now, at the first glimpse ofthis shawl I decided that it was not the one I sought, which Iimagined would scarcely be so bright and fresh-looking; but itwas the incongruity of that bright shawl, allied to such ragsand poverty, which made me slacken my pace, and almostinstinctively follow the owner of the child.
