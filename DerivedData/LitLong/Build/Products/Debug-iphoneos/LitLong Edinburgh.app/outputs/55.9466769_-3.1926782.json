D. 1809, \u00a34,000 ($20,000) to be expended in maintaining, clothing, and educating  poor boys\" there, while another memorial alongside is \"to the memory of John Allen, writer in Stirling, mortgaging A. D. 1735 the sum of 30,000 marks by which hundreds of young men have been able to advance themselves and to fill situations in life which their lot seemed to forbid.\" In Liverpool, too, you find the same idea in the striking monuments to James Nugent, bearing  the legend, \"Save the boy,\" while the significant  inscription on the monument to Major Lester reads: \"Give the child a fair chance.\"    "},{"title":"The works of Professor Wilson of the University of Edinburgh,","author":"Wilson, John","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t57d2xk6x","placename":"Greyfriars Church","snippet":"Margaret's mother had gone with her other two daughters to tlie Greyfriars Church, and after service had takeu a walk with them round the outskirts of that part of the town where she thought it likely they might meet with the little party coming up from Leith.
