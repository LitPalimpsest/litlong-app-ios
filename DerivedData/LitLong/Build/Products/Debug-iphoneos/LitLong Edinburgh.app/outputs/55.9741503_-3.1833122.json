He was the son of a farm-labourer, and when a mere child was sent to work in the fields. Despite many privations he managed to educate himself, and in 1819 he was fortunate enough to secure a publisher for his first work, foemi of Rural Life. The Quarterly Review, which had used Keats so harshly only a little time before, spoke of Clare in the highest terms of praise. The rustic poet was invited to London : for a season he was the lion of the town, and a subscription was raised which provided him with an income of about 45 a year. About fifteen years afterwards he became insane; for some time his wife nobly struggled to manage  him at home ; but at last he had to be conveyed to the Northampton County Asylum, where the remainder of his life was passed. Previous to that calamity he had added to his first book, The Village Minstrel, TM S\/tejJie.-d't Calendar, 1S27; and the Rural Muse, lt>35.
