We have, I may mention, during the last year (1888), got a funicular tramway, on which a system of superior carriages are constantly passing up and down from the Queensferry Road to Princes Street, so that at any moment we may run to Edinburgh, even on the most trifling mission, and be back within the half hour, and at a cost of twopence. We have thus the advantage  both of town and country life.
