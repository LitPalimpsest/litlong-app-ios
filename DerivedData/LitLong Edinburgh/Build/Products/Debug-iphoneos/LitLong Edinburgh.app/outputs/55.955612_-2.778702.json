Here was another dilemma: I must either get security, pay the money, or go with the officer, and my first speech in Boston to be given in a few hours ! The officer was very kind, and waited till my coat was mended, and then accompanied me to the Washingtonian headquarters, in Court Street, where one of the officers became security, and I returned to Mr. Grant's house. Immediately on his return he made an arrangement to assume or pay the debt till I could work it out.    "}]
