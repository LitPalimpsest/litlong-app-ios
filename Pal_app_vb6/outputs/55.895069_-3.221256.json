I declare, even if I had heard them, I should not have minded in the least, for I was quite persuaded that, whatever admirers I might be leaving behind me in Swanston Cottage, the aunt was not the least sincere.

I had conned it often enough from the other \u2022 side ; had looked right across it on the day when she stood beside me on the bastion and pointed out the smoke of Swanston Cottage. Only on this side the fish-tail (so to speak) had a nick in it ; and through that nick ran the path to the old quarry.

The first was, naturally, to get clear of Edinburgh Castle and the town, to say nothing of my fellow-prisoners ; the second to work to the southward so long as it was night, and be near Swanston Cottage by morning. What I should do there and then, I had no guess, and did not greatly care, being a devotee of a couple of divinities called Chance and Circumstance.

A moment later, with peals of happy laughter we had taken hands and were running along the garden alleys towards the house. And I remember, as we ran, finding it somewhat singular that this should be the first time I had ever invaded Swanston Cottage by way of the front door.

That is Swanston Cottage, where my brother and I are living with my aunt. If it gives you pleasure to see it, I am glad.

And then \u2014 whether it was the sudden chill of the night, whether it came by association of ideas from the remembrance of Swanston Cottage I know not, but there appeared before me\u2014 to the barking of sheepdogs \u2014 a couple of snuffy and shambling figures, each wrapped in a plaid, each armed with a rude staff ; and I was immediately bowed down to have forgotten them so long, and of late to have thought of them so cavalierly.
