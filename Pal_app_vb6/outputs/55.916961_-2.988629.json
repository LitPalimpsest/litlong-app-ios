Yet, with their usual pertinacity, they shortly after mustered about thirteen hundred men, who \" raid into England and brunt and herijt certane townes on the bordouris vnto Tilmouth ; \" and, on the twelfth of July following, the Earl of Angus was proclaimed lieutenant, and commanded the realm to follow him in an hour's warning, \" with foure dayis victuall, to pass on their aid enemies of Ingland.\"1 During the following year 1545-6, Edinburgh Castle was for a brief period the scene of Wishart's imprisonment, after his seizure by the Earl of Bothwell, and delivery into the hands of Cardinal Beaton, at Elphinstone Tower; an ancient keep, situated in East Lothian, about two miles from the village of Tranent. A wretched dungeon, under the great hall of Elphinstone, is still pointed out as the place of Wishart's imprisonment, as well as another room, in which the Cardinal slept at the same period.    "}]
