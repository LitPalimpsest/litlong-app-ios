It is styled, however, in the earliest titles extant, \" the old land formerly of George, Bishop of Dunkeld;\" so that its foundation may be referred with every probability to the reign of James V., when George Crighton, who occupied that see from the year 1527 to 1543,\"sounded the hospital of St Thomas near the Water-gate, about two years before his death, and endowed it for the maintenance of certain chaplains and bedemen, \" to celebrate the founder's anniversary obit, by solemnly singing in the choir of Holyrood church, on the day of his death yearly, the Placebo and Dirige, for the repose of his soul,\" Sec.3 There can be little doubt moreover that the old land, which was only demolished in the year 1789, was the same mansion of Lord Hcjme, to which Queen Mary retreated with Darnley, on her return to Edinburgh in 1566, while she was haunted with the horrible recollections of the recent murder of her favourite, Rizzio, and her mind revolted from the idea of returning to the palace, the scene of his assassination, whose blood-stained floors still called for justice and revenge against the murderers.
