This building stood immediately to the west of Free St John's Church ; it is described by Chambers1 as being of singular construction, and as full of curious little rooms, concealed closets, and secret stairs, as any house that ever had the honour of being haunted. The north wall, which still remains built into the range of shops forming the new terrace, stood long exposed to view, affording abundant evidence of this.    "}]
