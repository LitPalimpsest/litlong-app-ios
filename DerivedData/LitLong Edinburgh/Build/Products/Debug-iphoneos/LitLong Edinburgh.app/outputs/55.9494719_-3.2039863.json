The Princes Street Gardens are free to all, and it does not take two minutes to run down some steep wynd from the Lawnmarket, by the Castle, and cross the top of the Mound to the gate leading into West Princes Street Gardens, and so along a rough little path, high above the gay flower- beds and walks and seats, and skirt round the edge of the cliffs of the Castle Rock, and over a crazy footbridge and some rocks that protrude through the path, and so to the ruins of the Well-House Tower, the only bit left of the fifteenth-century wall.

These gardens are divided into East and West: the East Princes Street Gardens extending from the Waverley bridge to the Mound, and being thrown open to the public; the West Princes Street Gardens being on the other side of the Mound, and reserved for subscribers, although respectable strangers are readily admitted.
