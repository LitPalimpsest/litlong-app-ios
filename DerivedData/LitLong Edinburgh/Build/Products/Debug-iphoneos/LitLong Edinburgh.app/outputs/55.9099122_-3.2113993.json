Another evening Alec Yorke gave a \" one-man \" (himself) entertainment after dinner, in the Baroness's sitting-room \u2014 imitations of Sarah Bernhardt, Ellen Terry, Irving, Buckstone, and others, all uncommonly good. Old Mr Bradshaw was so convulsed with laughing that he nearly rolled off his chair.    "},{"title":"Sparks from a Locomotive; or Life and Liberty in Europe.

In the 'sixties I saw her in all her performances with the fine old Haymarket company (and what a company it was ! with Buckstone, Compton, Howe, Chippendale, Mrs. Chippendale, and others); in the old comedies, in support of E. A. Sothern ; in Gilbert's fairy comedies, The Wicked World, Pygmalion and Galatea, etc., and I saw her at the Gaiety and elsewhere; and I never saw her play a part in which she failed to win my admiration. I little dreamed in those days that it would ever be my lot to play with her, and yet it has fallen out that I have had the happiness of being associated with her in many big plays and scenes, and happy indeed was the man who had her invaluable aid.

The play was not over till five, and then Buckstone made a long speech in answer to a complimentary and by no means short poem spoken by a popular actress. He began by explaining why the Prince of Wales could not come to the performance, but had regretted, etc.; how the Duke of Connaught had been present during the early part of the play, but had been called away.

The era of the Kendals and John Hare at the St. James' was yet to come, but the happy reign of the Bancrofts, at the old Prince of Wales', behind the Tottenham Court Road, where the Scala now stands, had yet to close.

Smith and the Keeleys; saw Fanny Essler and Fanny Cerito in artistic ballets (not mere expositions of legs), and the brave sailor of the New Cut in his British hornpipe. Buckstone was then, as he long afterwards continued to be, the delight of the old Haymarket\u2014a theatre of pleasant associations, with its English comedies, steady going company, and general suggestiveness of ' going to the play,' as in the good old times; and with a hospitable pit, too, which, instead of shoving you under a dark shed, like most, made you at home in the house. Few, if any, remain of the favourite players of that time.    "}]
