Oursenior, too, will recollect with a sigh the Old Assembly Rooms, or Dun's Rooms, or the George's-Street Rooms, when first opened as a place of public amusement, where all persons, of rank andfashion entitling them to frequent such places, metupon easy and upon equal terms, and without anyattempt at intrusion on the part of others; wherethe pretensions of every one were known andjudged of by their birth and manners, and not byassumed airs of extro.vagance, or a lavish displayof wealth; and he will conclude, upon the whole,that the society of the higher classes in Edinburghwas formerly more select, the members betterknown to each other, and, therefore, more easy inintercourse than at the present day.
