At the lower end comes one pretty peep of the green Pentlands across a meadowy vale, and they would have been visible all along the lower road but for the endless stone walls of ' Canaan Park,' ' Eden Hermitage,' ' Harmony House,' and other mansions. The ' Jordan' burn flows through the valley.    "}]
