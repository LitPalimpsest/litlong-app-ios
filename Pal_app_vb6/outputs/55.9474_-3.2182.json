Lansdowne Crescent, Lansdowne Circus, Lans downe Terrace, Regent Street, Warwick Street, Claren don Street, the Upper and Lower Parade : such are a few of the designations. Parade, indeed, is a well-chosen name for the principal street, along which the population of the idle town draws itself out for daily review and dis play.

After a good dinner at the Eegent, on the Lower Parade, we strolled over Leicester, Kegent, and Warwick streets, Holly Walk, The Lansdowne Crescent and Circus, and thence through the fine Jephson Gardens.
