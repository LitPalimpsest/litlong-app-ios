Perhaps, indeed, setting aside the political taints which have been noted as emanating from the Athens, it were just as well for Scotland, and not a bit worse for England, that Athenian education of all kinds were confined between the Loch of Duddingstone and the Water of Leith. Of those again who are thus educated, and who remain in the Athens, it may perhaps be said that they turn round and inflict upon those who come after, full retribution for what those who went before inflicted upon themselves ; and that with all her boasted elegance and taste, there is perhaps no city in which vice is more generally or more obtrusively practised, than in this self-ljoasted model of taste and purity.

It was at Duddingstone that Thomson first devoted himself to landscape painting as a profession. Craigmillar was before his eyes every time he looked out of his window, and this subject he frequently painted \u2014 often with grand effect by moonlight.

When Thomson came up to Edinburgh as a student, he made the acquaintance of Scott and Jeffrey, and during life his friendship with both remained unimpaired.

Descending on Duddingstone, you find it retired, low-lying, sunshiny, umbrageous ; a place in which in summer you may expect plenty of dust in the narrow streets, plenty of drowsy bees around the double-flowered white and purple stocks in the gardens, plenty of flies buzzing in the sunny parlour windows.

While at Dailly he distributed landscapes amongst his friends; at Duddingstone he accepted payment. The first picture was sold for fifteen guineas ; and the artist, it is said, was so startled by the mighty sum, that it was only when Mr Williams, the delineator of Greek scenery, whom he consulted on the subject, told him that the work was worth three times as much, that he could comfortably consign the coins to his breeches pocket.

As a clergyman, he was much esteemed by his parishioners, consisting mainly of well-to-do folks who lived in villas, small market -gardeners who brought their produce into Edinburgh, and washerwomen who worked for the inhabitants of the city, washing the clothes in the loch, and bleaching and drying them on the slopes of Arthur's Seat, where they caught the scent of the broom.
