The very name of York Place serves to preserve the notion they entertained, that the south side of that street was to be the extreme northern boundary of the extended royalty, looking out on an uninterrupted view towards the sea ; and to the same idea we are in some degree indebted for the Queen Street gardens, which now form so beautiful and valuable a feature of the New Town. It may be presumed, indeed, that the courageous adventurers who first began to build on these remote outskirts of modern civilization, as little dreamt of extending buildings interrupting their viyv, as an inhabitant of Brighton Parade, or the builder of a marine villa on the sands of Portobcllo, could anticipate sonic daring speculator rearing houses between him and the sea !
