The van was led by the magistrates, in a coach which previously knew every street and lane of the city, but which was relackered for the occasion, had the city arms emblazoned upon it as large as a pullicate handkerchief, and was drawn by eight grey horses of the genuine Lanarkshire breed, \u2014 the thunder of whose feet, as they dashed along, shook the kirk of Shotts, and had nearly laid Airdrie and Bathgate in ruins.
