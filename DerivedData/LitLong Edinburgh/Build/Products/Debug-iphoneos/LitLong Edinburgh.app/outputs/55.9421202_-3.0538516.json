When we were talking of David, Mrs Carlyle asked Mr Boyle if he thought David Hume was as great an unbeliever as the world took him to be ? He answered, that the world judged from his books, as they had a right to do ; but he thought otherwise, who had known him all his life, and mentioned the folio wins; incident : When David and he were both in London, at the period when David's mother died, Mr Boyle, hearing of it, soon after went into his apartment \u2014 for they lodged in the same house \u2014 when he found him in the deepest affliction and in a flood of tears.
