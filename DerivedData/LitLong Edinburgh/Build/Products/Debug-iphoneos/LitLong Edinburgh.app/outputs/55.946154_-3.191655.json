The great recommendation, however, is that, instead of being a principal, I am hooked to my good friend John Niven, with whom I every day perambulate the delightful purlieus of the West Port and the neighbourhood, sometimes steering across the 'bridge that spans' that prince of ditches, the Canal, and at other times winging our flight to the Grassmarket ; and winding up all by journeying to the West Kirk Charity Workhouse, where we have charge of all the little urchins' health and welfare. So you see I am a great man in the way of practice, and not destitute at least of patients, and the means of learning that branch of medicine.    "},{"title":"The Novels of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.

Our first interview with Beni was in Peebles about 1805, and the last time we saw him was in 1839, in the Edinburgh Charity Workhouse, where this aged and industrious man had at length found a sheltering roof under which to die. Here were learned the leading particulars of Beni's variegated life.    "},{"title":"Waverley Novels.

Mr. Spooner, brother-in-law to Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. James of Birmingham, and the Rev. Mr. Lowe of Darlaston, with whom I had most interesting conversation on the subject of his parish pauperism.* Lord Calthorpe made an arrangement with me that will take effect in a subsequent part of my journey. After they went off, Mr. Knott and others moved along with me through Birmingham, where I visited the Charity Workhouse, and made a call or two ; then came back to an early dinner at Mr. Knott's, along with the two Mr. Hunters, of whom I wrote in my last letter. They are truly extravagant in their kindness.    "}]
