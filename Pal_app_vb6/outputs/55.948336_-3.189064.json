At the top of the Potterrow is a lane at the back of the College, which led to another lane called the Horse Wynd, which descended to the Cowgate. Right across the Cowgate is the Fishmarket Close, the top of which debouched on the High Street, but near the top of the close was a stair leading to the Parliament Close or Square immediately at the end of the High Church or St Giles'.
