The present entrance to Hunter Square was the site of the Black Turnpike, the town residence, in 1567, of Sir Simon Preston of Craigmillar, then provost, in which Mary spent her last night in Edinburgh. The Black Turnpike afterwards became the property of George Heriot, and was demolished in 1788.    "}]
