We have already referred to the house which forms the junction with St Andrew Square and St David Street, as the last residence of the celebrated philosopher and historian, David Hume; where that strange death-bed scene occurred, which has been the subject of such varied comments both by the eulogists and detractors of the great sceptic. Directly opposite to Hume's house, on the north side of the square, is the house in which Henry Brougham was born.

So does it that a Mr Shadrach Moyes, on ordering- a house to be built for himself in Princes Street, in 1769, took the builder bound to rear another further along- by his, to shield him from the west wind ! Other quaint particulars are remembered ; as, for instance \u2014 A Mr Wight, an eminent lawyer, who had planted himself in St Andrew Square, finding- he was in dang-er of having- his view of St Giles's clock shut up by the advancing- line of Princes Street, built the intervening house himself, that he might have it in his power to keep the roof low, for the sake of the view in question ; important to him, he said, as enabling- him to regulate his movements in the morning-, when it was necessary that he should be punctual in his attendance at the Parliament House.

A t that period St Andrew Square contained the residences of several noblemen, and was deemed the most fashionable quarter ofHhe risino- town. The house on the same side at the corner of St Andrew Street, was the mansion of David Steuart Earl of Buchan, and possesses some claim to our interest as the place where the Society of Scottish Antiquaries was instituted in 1780, and where its earliest meetings were held.1 Within the first eastern division of George Street, the eye of the modern visitor is attracted by the lofty and magnificent portico of the Commercial Bank, a building that seems destined to attest for ages the skill and taste, if not the inventive genius, of our native architects; yet it occupies the site of the Physician's Hall, a chaste Grecian edifice designed by Craig, the foundation stone of which was laid by the celebrated Dr Cullen, in 1774, doubtless with the belief that remote ages might bring to licht the memorials which were then buried in its foundations.

I got to the top of it without coming on any likely loungers or loiterers, and then brightened as I caught sight of a knot of street porters, waiting at their stand at the corner of St Andrew Square. I crossed over, and addressed the sharpest looking among them.

Mr Crosbie afterwards removed to the splendid mansion erected by him in St Andrew Square, ornamented with engaged pillars and a highly decorated attic storey, which stands to the north of the Royal Bank ;4 but he was involved, with many others, in the failure of the Ayr Bank, and died in such poverty, in 1785, that his widow owed her sole support to an annuity of \u00a350 granted by the Faculty of Advocates.

As the New Town was making its progress westward, he built a house in the south-west corner of St Andrew Square. The street leading south to Princes Street had not yet got its name aflSxed, but they got a workman early one morning to paint on the corner-stone of David's house \" St David's Street,\" where it remains to this day.

The aristocratic style of the place alarmed a number of pockets, and legal men trembled lest their clients and other employers should forget them, if they removed so far from the centre of things as Princes Street and St Andrew Square.

Perhaps, if it be premised that a corresponding street at the other angle of St Andrew Square is called St Andrew Street \u2014 a natural enough circumstance with reference to the square, whose title was determined on in the plan \u2014 it will appear likely that the choosing of ' St David Street ' for that in which Hume's house stood, was not originally designed as a jest at his expense, though a second thought, and the whim of hia    "},{"title":"Fraud and Friendship; or the orphan and the foundling of the King's printing-house.
