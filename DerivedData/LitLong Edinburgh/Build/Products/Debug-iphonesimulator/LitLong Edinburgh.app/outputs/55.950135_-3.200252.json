The emigration, however, of the gentry of the old town to the more fashionable dwellings beyond the North Loch had been very partially effected in 1788, and the contrast between the little parlour in General's Entry, and the drawing-rooms of the Poet's wealthier hosts, was by no means so marked and striking as it afterwards became. Such are the strangely mingled associations of rank, historic fame, and genius, with lowly worth and squalid poverty, which still linger around so many old nooks of the Scottish capital, and give so peculiar an interest to its scenes.

Only six years before the commencement of the works beyond the North Loch, Sir Robert Mylne was employed to furnish the design for St Cecilia's Hall, in the Cowgate. It was built after the model of the great theatre Farnese at Parma, and though now long deserted by the votaries of St Cecilia, it was admirably adapted for the purposes of a concert-room ; its oval forni and elliptical ceiling, as well as the skilful arrangement of the seats, uniting to convey every note clear and distinct to the auditors.
