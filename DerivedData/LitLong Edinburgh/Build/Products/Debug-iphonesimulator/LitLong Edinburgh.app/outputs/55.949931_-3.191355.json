Being so long in the enjoyment of his official title, the close in which he resided received the name of \" the Advocate's Close.\" The house in which he lived and died is at the foot of the close, on the west side, immediately before descending a flight of steps that somewhat lessen the abruptness of the steep descent.2 In 1769, Sir James Stewart, grandson of the Lord Advocate, sold the house to David Dalrymple of Westhall, Esq., who, when afterwards raised to the Bench, assumed the title of Lord Westhall, and continued to reside in this old mansion till his death.3 This ancient alley retains, nearly unaltered, the same picturesque overhanging gables and timber projections which have, without doubt, characterised it for centuries, and may be taken as a very good sample of a fashionable close in the palmy days of Queen Anne.

My father saw them toom the sacks of dollars out o' Provost Dick's window, intill the carts that carried them to the army at Dunse Law; and if ye winna believe his testimony, there is the window itsell still standing in the Luckenbooths,\u2014at the aim stanchells, five doors abune Advocate's Close\".4 The old timber gable and the stanchelled window of this Scottish Cr\u0153sus, have vanished, like his own dollars, beyond recall, but there is no doubt that the modern and unattractive stone front, extending between Byres' and Advocate's Closes, only disguises the remarkable building to which such striking historical associations belong. The titles include, not only a disposition of the property to Sir William Dick of Braid, but the appraising and disposition of it by his creditors after his death ; and its situation is casually confirmed by a contemporary notice that indicates its importance at the period.

Would that these things had so continued ; but there are other wolves than those of poverty, and the \"ae lamb o' the fauld\" cannot be always under the protection of the ewe ; and so it happened on a certain night, not particularised in the calendar, that our Mysie, having finished one of these floral petticoats on which she had been engaged for many weeks, went forth with her precious burden to deliver the same to its impatient owner \u2014 no other than the then famous Anabella Gilroy, who resided in Advocate's Close.
