The building of St Andrew's Church on its present site was suggested at a later peiiod, as an appropriate counterpoise to the Physicians' Hall, erected in 1775.

The proportions and ornamental details of Craig's great work, the Physicians' Hall, indicated a practical acquaintance with ancient models, beyond which comparatively few of our modern architects ever venture. He died in Edinburgh, on the '23d of June 1795.
