Urged by some strong instinct, my grandfather grasped him by the throat ; for, by the glimpse of the lights that were then placing at every window, he saw it was Winterton.

An inspection of the back wall of the Mint, in Todrick's Wynd, confirms the idea of its having succeeded to a more ancient building of considerable architectural pretensions ; as, on minute examination, various carved stones will be observed built up among the materials of the rubble    "},{"title":"Elizabeth de Bruce,","author":"Johnstone, C.

Todrick's Wynd acquires a special interest from its association with a memorable deed in the bloody annals of our national history. It was by this ancient alley that the Earl of Bothwell and his merciless accomplices and hirelings proceeded towards the gate of the Blackfriars' Monastery, in the Cowgate, on the 9th of February 1567, to fire the powder by which the house of the Provost of the Kirkof-Field was blown into the air, and Lord Darnley, with his servant, Taylor, slain.

The roof is surmounted by a range of crow steps of the form already described as peculiar to the fifteenth, or earlier part of the sixteenth centuries ; and an outside stair leads to the first floor, where the ancient stone turnpike remains in its original state, decorated with the abreviated motto, in fine ornamental gothic characters : DEO ' HONOR \u25a0 ET \u25a0 GLIA -1 Another inscription, we are told, still exists over the entrance from Todrick's Wynd, being only covered up with plaster, by a former tenant, to save the expense of a signboard. A little way down this wynd, on the east side, a favourite motto appears, in bold Roman letters, over an ancient doorway, repeating with slight variation the same sentiment already noticed in other instances . The feir of the lord is the begening of visdome.

Two large and handsome windows, above the archway leading to Todrick's Wynd, give light to this once magnificent hall, which is said to have formed the council-room, where the officers of the Mint assembled to assay the metal, and to discuss the general affairs of the establishment. Here was the scene of the splendid banquet given \" at the requeist of the Kingis Majestie and for honour of the toun,\" to the Danish nobles and ambassadors, who came over in the train of Anne, Queen of James VI., in 1590.
