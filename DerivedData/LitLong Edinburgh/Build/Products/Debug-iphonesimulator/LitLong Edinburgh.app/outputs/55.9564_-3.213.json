This name of Jamaica Street, and also that of Virginia Street, may have suggested to our minds that there had been, at some time or other, an intimate acquaintance between Glasgow and tobacco.

After mutual concessions and denunciations of the cunning and perfidy of Mr Brady's servants, M'Sweeny had advised the gardener to send for a bit of raw beefsteak, and was himself busy fastening that on the gardener's eye, when, in looking over the mantelpiece for a pin with which to fix the bandage, his eye fell on an old watch-seal there lying.

The crooked streets and narrow lanes reminded me much of Hanover Street, Ann Street, and other portions of the North End of our American Boston, as I remember that picturesque region in my boyish days. It is not un reasonable to suppose that the local habits and recollec tions of the first settlers may have had some influence on the physical character of the streets and houses in the New England metropolis ; at any rate, here is a similar intricacy of bewildering lanes, and numbers of old peaked and projecting-storied dwellings, such as I used to see there.
