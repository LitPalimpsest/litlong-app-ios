No passion agitated sweet Mary Stuart, no wild dreams of imagination, no enthusiastic transports  of the fancy ; but his smile was light, and his voice was music to her soul ; and in the serein' depth of an affection which had been growing within her heart, even from the very first moment she beheld the Btranger in the Pine Grove, would she now have willingly gone with him to the uttermost parts of the earth, or laid down her young and happy life for his sake. When he folded her to his heart, as they mutually pledged their faith, her tears fell down in showers, and the i thai then touched hereyea and cheek thrilled with unutterable happiness through her innocent and virgin heart.
