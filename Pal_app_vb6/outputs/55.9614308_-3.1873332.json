The town of Restalrig, the burgh of Broughton, and the several villages now inclosed within the New Town, all belong to the ancient suburban features of the Scottish capital ; and the description which has been given of the site of the New Town, and of its very singular antiquities, renders its present appearance a fit illustration to these pages. All these features are included in this map, which serves also to exhibit in some degree the striking contrast between the New and Old Town, though it is impossible, by means of any plan, to convey to a stranger a correct idea of the peculiar characteristics of the Scottish capital, arising from the singular inequalities of its site.

In the month of August, 1744, John Murray of Broughton, who had been for three or four years an agent of the old Chevalier, and much trusted by him and his adherents, returned to Paris from Scotland, carrying with him the joint opinion of the Jacobites in that country upon the subject of an invasion. Mr. Murray was a gentleman of honourable birth and competent fortune, being the son of Sir David Murray, by his second wife, a daughter of Sir John Scott of Ancrum.

And here, as a last notable fact, were Prince Charles and his father proclaimed by their devoted Highlanders, amidst screams of pipe and blare of trumpet, while the beautiful Mrs Murray of Broughton sat beside the party on horseback, adorned with white ribbons, and with a drawn sword in her hand ! How strange it seems that a time should at length have come when a set of magistrates thought this structure an incumbrance to the street, and had it removed.

The place of his final retreat was Drummelzier, a village in the Valley of the Tweed, between Broughton (Station) and Stobo ; repeated allusion was made by him, throughout his later poems, to \" the chancel on the top of tho hill,\" which was supposed to refer to the church of Drummelzier. It was said he was stoned and beaten to death in this locality and his body thrown into the river, and thus the later Orpheus perished like the earlier.

It was, therefore, necessary to discover among the late counsellors of the Chevalier, some individual who loved life better than honour and fidelity to a ruined cause; and such a person was unhappily found in John Murray of Broughton, secretary to Charles Edward. This unfortunate gentleman, as we have already seen, was intimately acquainted with the circumstances in which the rebellion had originated, had been most active in advancing the Chevalier's interest, both in civil and military affairs; and though he considerably embroiled his master's affairs, by fanning the discord between the Duke of Perth and Lord George Murray, and stimulating the Chevalier's dislike to the latter nobleman; yet it would    "},{"title":"Memoir of James Wyld of Gilston, and his family","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/95743043","placename":"Broughton","snippet":"xiii Our remoter ancestors, as well as our more immediate predecessors , flourished in the south-western counties of Scotland, especially in Lanark and Peebles, and their tombstones are still to be found in the parishes of Biggar, Dunsyre, Walston, Carnwath, and generally throughout Tweeddale and the upper wards of Lanark.
