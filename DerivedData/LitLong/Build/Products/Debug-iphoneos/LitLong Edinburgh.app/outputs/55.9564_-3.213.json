This old house was reached by a broad avenue of trees and shrubbery from Ann Street, where we lived for some years ; this would be about 1820. This interesting old house was surrounded by large green fields, a fine orchard of apple and pear- trees, and leading from this was another avenue of old stately elms, part of which still remain with the rookery in St. Bernard's Crescent.

It was a part of town that she knew quite well; her art historian friend Susanna Kerr lived there, as had her father's cousin, a clever, bird-like woman who had been an expert in palaeography and Celtic place-names.

After mutual concessions and denunciations of the cunningand perfidy of Mr Brady's servants, M'Sweeny had advised thegardener to send for a bit of raw beefsteak, and was himselfbusy fastening that on the gardener's eye, when, in looking overthe mantelpiece for a pin with which to fix the bandage, hiseye fell on an old watch-seal there lying.
