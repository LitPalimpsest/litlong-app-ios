[{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Fisher's Close","snippet":"To the east of this ancient quadrangle, there stood, till within these few years, the old town residence of the Buccleuch family, entering from Fisher's Close, demolished about 1835, to make way for Victoria Ten-ace ; and immediately beyond this, in Brodie's Close, there still remains, in the Roman Eagle Hall, an exceedingly beautiful specimen of a large and highly decorated ancient saloon. This, however, falls to be treated of in another Chapter ; but the same old close,\u2014ere the besom of modern \" improvement\" swept over it with indiscriminate destruction,\u2014contained various dwellings, pleasingly associated with the memories of some of Edinburgh's worthiest citizens in the \" The Olden Time.\"    "}]
