The road between Belton and Chillingham is a beautiful one, passing through wild open country with views bounded by the Cheviots. On arriving, I was shown into a room with a window deep in the old masonry of the tower, the walls of this room covered with tapestry, of which two large panels are interesting, representing the sea and the earth in the forms of Neptune and Amphytrite.
