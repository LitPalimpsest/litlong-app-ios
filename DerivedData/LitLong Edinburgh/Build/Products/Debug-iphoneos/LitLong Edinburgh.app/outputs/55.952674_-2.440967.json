The venerable Bede fixes the beginning of the wall at old Kirkpatrick, notwithstanding that it was extended to Dunglas between the present Cockburnspath and Innerwick,* and the end to Caerridden on the Frith of Forth, near Abercorn, which in the seventh century was the seat of an English Bishop of the Picts. The length of the wall is 39 Roman miles and 717 paces.    "},{"title":"Early Travellers in Scotland. Edited by P. Hume Brown.
