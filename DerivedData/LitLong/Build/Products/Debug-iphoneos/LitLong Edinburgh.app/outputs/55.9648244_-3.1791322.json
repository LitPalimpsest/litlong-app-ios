There was a revival of the spirit of life and gladness over the garden, and the one encircling field of Sunnyside ; and so likewise, under the grace of God, was there a revival of the soul that had been sorrowing within its concealment. On the first sweet dewy Sabbath of May, the widow was seen closing  behind her the little white gate, which for some months her hand had not touched.

During three months, Sunnyside looked almost as if uninhabited. Yet the smoke from one chimney told that the childless widow was sitting alone at her fireside  ; and when her only servant was spoken to at church, or on the village-green, and asked how her mistress was bearing these dispensations,  the answer was, that her health seemed little, if at all impaired,  and that she talked of coming to divine service in a few weeks, if her strength would permit.

On approaching the village, strangers always fixed upon Sunnyside for the Manse itself, for an air of serenity and retirement brooded over it as it looked out from below its sheltering elms, and the farmyard with its corn-stack, marking the homestead of the agricultural tenant, was there wanting. A neat gravel-walk winded away, without a weed, from the white gate by the road-side, through lilacs and Laburnums ; and the unruffled and unbroken order of all the breathing things that grew around, told that a quiet and probably small family lived within those beautiful boundaries.
