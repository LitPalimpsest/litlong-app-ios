I know well about the inner life and work of at least our Infirmary, and of that noble, old Minto House, now gone ; and I would rather infinitely, were I a servant, 'prentice boy, or shopman, a porter, or student, and anywhere but in a house of my own, and even then, go straight to the Infirmary, than lie in a box- bed off the kitchen, or on the top of the coal-bunker, or in a dark hole in the lobby, or in a double-bedded room. The food, the bedding, the physicians, the surgeons, the clerks, the dressers, the medicines, the wine and porter, \u2014 and they don't scrimp these when necessary, \u2014 the books, the Bibles, the baths, are all good ; are all better far than one man in ten thousand can command in his own house.
