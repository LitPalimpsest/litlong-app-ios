The last years of Ramsay's life were passed in a straggling stucco house off the present Ramsay Place and Ramsay Gardens, standing now very much as Ramsay built it, with a little bit of green behind it, and all of the New Town of Edinburgh at its front; having from its windows a fine view of the Castle, of a long line of streets and spires, and of a beautiful stretch of open country. Architecturally it cannot be commended, but it is superbly placed, and it hardly merits the name \" Goose Pie,\" given it because of its peculiar shape by the would-be humorists of Ramsay's day.

I walked down Prince-street, crossed the \" Mound \" which connects 'the 'New Town with the Old, passed in front of the new Free Church College, an imposing edifice, through Ramsay Place, so called from the home of Allan Ramsay, the author of \" The Gentle Shepherd,\" and by a private path up the hill, came out on the Esplanade of the Castle, where a company of soldiers in the Highland dress were going through their militaiy exercises under the drill sergeant. I passed around the batteries and saw the celebrated \" Mons J\/e^,\" a gigantic piece of artillery which was cast at Mons in Flanders.    "}]
