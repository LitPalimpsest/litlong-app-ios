At this moment I was standing chatting for a minute with the sergeant for the district at the head of Forres Street, before taking my way home from a troublesome job out at the Dean Bridge; and not a little astonished we both were to see a servant girl flying past us in a demented way, waving a brass kettle and screaming \" Murder! \" at the top of her voice. I ran after her and held her fast, but still did she give forth the terrified screams, till the sergeant suggested that perhaps she was some escaped lunatic; when she recovered sufficiently to point wildly down in the direction of Moray Place with the nozzle of the kettle in her hand\u2014    "},{"title":"Literary landmarks of Edinburgh,","author":"Hutton, Laurence","year":"1891-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=yale.39002085618974","placename":"Forres Street","snippet":"DE FOE AND OTHERS 69 Among the men and women distinguished in the world of letters who at some time or other have breathed the reekie atmosphere of Edinburgh may be mentioned De Foe, who once edited the \" Courant ;\" Richard Steele, who is said to have lodged in Lady Stair's Close ; Goldsmith, who lodged in the College Wynd ; Rev.

Professor Syme one day, many years ago, when living in Forres Street, was looking out of his window, and he saw a young shepherd striding down North Charlotte Street, as if making for his house ; it was midsummer. The man had his dog with him, and Mr. Syme noticed that he followed the dog, and not it him, though he contrived to steer for the house.
