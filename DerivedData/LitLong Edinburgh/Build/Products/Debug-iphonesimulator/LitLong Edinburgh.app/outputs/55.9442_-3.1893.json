Even those modern districts connected with it, as St John Street, New Street, George Square, &c. were beginning to be forsaken for the sake of more elegantly-circumstanced habitations beyond the North Loch. Into the remote social consequences of this change it is not my purpose to enter, beyond the bare remark, that it was only too accordant with that tendency of our pi*esent form of civilisation to separate the high from the low, the intelligent from the ignorant \u2014 that dissociation, in short, which would in itself run nigh to be a condemnation of all progress, if we were not allowed to suppose that better forms of civilisation are realisable.
