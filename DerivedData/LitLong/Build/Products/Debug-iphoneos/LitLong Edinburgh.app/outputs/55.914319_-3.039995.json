It was the work of years to construct andbuild a lighthouse on a rock in the midst of the stormy seas, but athird was built by Smeaton in 1759, this time made of granite andPortland stone, and modelled after the shape of the trunk of an old oaktree. The stones had been prepared on land, and were sent to the rock asrequired for the various positions, and so the lighthouse was raised inabout four months.
