Two or three years afterwards I met him in Edinburgh one Sunday morning as he was returning from the Friends' Meeting-House to Newington House, where he was staying with his brother - in - law \u2014 Mr. Duncan M'Laren. We got into conversation, and he spoke a good deal about the British policy in the East.    "}]
