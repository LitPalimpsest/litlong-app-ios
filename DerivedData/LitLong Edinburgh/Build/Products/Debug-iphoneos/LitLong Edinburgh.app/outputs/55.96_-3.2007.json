A man was walking up Dundas Street; a man wearing a chocolate- brown corduroy jacket of the fusty, vaguely raffish sort once worn by art teachers. He stopped and patted the pockets of his jacket, as if feeling for something that he hoped he had brought with him, before glancing in through  the caf\u00e9 window.

She had arranged to meet Stella Moncrieff in Glass and Thompson, the caf\u00e9 at the top of Dundas Street that she liked to frequent. It was on the other side of town  for both her and Stella \u2013 Princes Street being the divider, every bit as effective  as a swift-flowing river, that split the city in two \u2013 but she liked that part of town with its galleries and views of the Fife hills.

He  had promised, though, to come down to see her in Dundas  Street once he closed up at lunch time. He would bring  her some bacon, he said, so that she could make bacon rolls  for any customers who might like to try them.

In Dundas Street he  waited patiently until a No. 23 bus lumbered along the  road towards them.

This  was the place from which she dispensed cups of latte and  cappuccino from eight in the morning until six at night,  hours that were on the generous side: hardly anybody came  into the coffee bar before half past nine, and it would have  made no dent in Big Lou's turnover if she were not to open  until then.

Skiers also know  it, having had it drummed into them at ski school: do not  look down at your skis but keep your gaze focused on where  you want to be; funambulists too: they know that should  they glance down at those curious, ballet-type shoes they  wear, then they will lose their balance and fall; and so they  look steadfastly ahead, their eyes focused on some point  just beyond the end of the singing wire, as Matthew now  focused his gaze on the junction of Heriot Row and Dundas  Street, never before studied with such longing intensity.

This was Matthew, who had just  locked up his gallery in Dundas Street and had decided to  spend half an hour or so in the Cumberland Bar before  returning to the flat in India Street. When one is the father  of triplets, as Matthew was, the prospect of returning after  bath-time, rather than before it, was an attractive one.

When they got off the bus on Dundas Street, he ran  all the way along Cumberland Street, having promised his  father to wait for him at the Dundonald Street end. And once  Stuart had caught up with him, he then ran the remaining  distance to their front door and was waiting for Stuart when  he arrived.

So she crossed town on foot, walking down Dundas Street and stopping briefly at the galleries to pass the time before Jamie might be expected to be on his last pupil. There was nothing to interest her in the gallery windows, and nothing inside either; she was too uneasy to appreciate art.

That, thought Isabel, was what distinguished Dundas Street galleries from many of the  expensive galleries in London and Paris, where bells had to be rung before the door was opened. And even then, once the door had been unlocked, the welcome, if it was a welcome, was grudging and suspicious.

Dundas Street was a street of galleries.
