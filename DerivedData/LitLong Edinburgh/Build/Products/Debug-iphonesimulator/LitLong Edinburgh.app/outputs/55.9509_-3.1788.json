In \" Bakehouse Close,\" is to be found the old house of the Earls of Gosford, in former times a splendid structure, but now inhabited by the poorest people. Near to this stands the palace of a still famous family, the Earls of Moray; and a little way off, that of the Duke of Queensberry, now a house for beggars.    "}]
