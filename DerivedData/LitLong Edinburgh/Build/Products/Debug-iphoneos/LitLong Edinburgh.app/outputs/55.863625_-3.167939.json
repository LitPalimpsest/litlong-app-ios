The railway, on leaving the Bridge of Allan, skirts the river Allan, and, passing by a tunnel through the grounds of Kippercross, reaches the old-fashioned village of Dunblane, which contains a cathedral, one of the few specimens of Gothic architecture which immeasurably excels those of both Melrose and Roslin in beauty of proportion and depth and force of moulding.
