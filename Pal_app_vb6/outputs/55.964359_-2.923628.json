He was received by Louis XIV with the utmost generosity and hospitality, and lived for many years at St Germains, under his protection and at his expense, excepting only during a short campaign (to be afterwards noticed) in Ireland. Every effort to replace him in his dominions, only proved destructive to those who were engaged in them.    "},{"title":"The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott.

But he alleged that the former destroyed tlie effect of her beauty by an affectation of the grand airs which she had probably seen practised in the mock court of St Germains. As for Rose Bradwardine, he said it was impossible for any mortal to admire such a little uninformed thing, whose small portion of education was as ill adapted to her sex or youth, as if she had appeared with one of her father's old campaign-coats upon her person for her sole garment.

As to lhe important point of a General to command in chief, the scheme, when originally contemplated at the Court of St Germains, turned upon the Duke of Ormond's landing iu England, and the Duke of Berwick in Scotland, whose well-known talents were to direct the whole affair. After commencing his insurrection, there can be little doubt that Mar did the utmost, by his agents iu Lorraine, lo engage the favourable opinion of the Chevalier; and the unexpected success of his enterprise, so far as it had gone, and the great power he had been able to assemble, were well cal-    "},{"title":"The Prose Works of Sir Walter Scott.

Here he \"endeavoured to recommend himself at tlie court of St Germains, by affecting much zeal for the Jacobite cause, and pretending to great interest with the Highland chiefs, aud the power of rendering effectual service amongst them.

He had, almost b} his single and unassisted talents, stopped the irruption of the banded force of all the Highland chiefs; there was little doubt, that, with the slightest encouragement, lie could put them all in motion and renew the civil war; and it was well known that the most flattering overtures had been transmitted to the Duke from the court of St Germains. The character and temper of Scotland was still little known, and it was considered as a volcano, which might, indeed, slumber for a series of years, but was still liable, at a moment the least unexpected, to break out into a wasteful eruption.
