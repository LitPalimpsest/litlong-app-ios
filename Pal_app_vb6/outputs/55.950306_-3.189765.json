Burns was introduced to this club in 1787, while in Edinburgh superintending the printing of his poems, when, according to custom, one of the corps was pitted against the Poet in a contest of wit and irony.

It need not surprise us to learn that even the original manuscripts of Burns were invariably converted to such homely purposes; the estimation of the poet being very different in 1787 from what it has since become. Of traditions of remote antiquity, the Anchor Close has its full share ; and the numerous inscriptions, as well as the general character of the old buildings that rear their tall and irregular fronts along its west side, still attest its early importance. Immediately on entering the close from the High Street the visitor discovers this inscription, tastefully carved over the first entrance within the pond : THE . LORD . IS \u2022 ONLY \u25a0 MY \u2022 SVPORT '; and high overhead, above one of the windows facing down the close a carved stone bears a shield with the date 1569, and, on its third and fourth quarters, a pelican feeding her young with her own blood.
