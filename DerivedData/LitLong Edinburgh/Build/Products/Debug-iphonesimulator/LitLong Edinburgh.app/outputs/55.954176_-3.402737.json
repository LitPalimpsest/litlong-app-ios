What was the old lady's motive for such a request, or whether she really made such a promise, 1 cannot take upon me to determine; but it is certain her coffin stands upright in the aisle of the church of Kirkliston, the burialplace of the family.\"* The talents of this accomplished' race were sufficient to have accounted for the dignities which many members of the family attained, without any supernatural assistance. But their extraordinary prosperity was attended by some equally singular family misfortunes, of which that which befell their eldest daughter was at once unaccountable and melancholy.
