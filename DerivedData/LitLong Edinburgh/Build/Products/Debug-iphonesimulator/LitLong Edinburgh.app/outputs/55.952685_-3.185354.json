It was proposed to take possession of this house, and, after clearing the wall by a fire of musketry from the upper windows, either to altempt an escalade, or to run a mine under the fortification At the same time, the position of the hospital called Paul's Work was favourably situated to cover an attack on the main sluice of the North Loch. The College Church gave ready means of gaining the hospital; and an alarm on the northern termination of the wall would have afforded a point of diversion, while the main attack might be made by means of the row of houses in St Mary's Wynd, composing the western side of that lane, and actually built upon, and forming part of the wall, which in that place was merely a range of buildings.

The partizans of the latter probably considered it vain to compete with a lawyer at his own weapons, and his uncle, Sir James Sandilands, accompanied by a body of his friends and followers, lay in wait for the judge on the 1st of February 1592, in the wynd, which then formed one of the principal avenues to the town, and avenged their quarrel by murdering him in open day, without any of the perpetrators being brought to trial or punishment.1 At the foot of the wynd still stands the building known as Paul's Work, rebuilt in 1619, on the site of an ancient religious foundation. About the year 1479, Thomas Spence, Bishop of Aberdeen, founded an hospital there, for the reception and entertainment of twelve poor men, and dedicated it to the Virgin Mary, under the name of the Hospital of our Lady in Leith Wynd, and it subsequently received considerable augmentation to its revenues from other benefactors.

It is a long view, with the Calton Hill forming the foreground, beyond which Trinity College Church, and Paul's Work appear on one side, with the North Loch stretching away towards the Well-house Tower. The large ancient church of the Castle, as well as St Margaret's Chapel, form prominent objects in the Castle ; while in the town the Netherbow Port, the old High School, demolished in 1777, and others of the ancient features of the city are introduced with considerable care and accuracy of detail.
