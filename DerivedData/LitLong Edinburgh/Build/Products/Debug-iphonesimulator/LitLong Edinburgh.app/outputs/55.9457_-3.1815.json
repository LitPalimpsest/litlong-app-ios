Alexander Alesse, a canon of St Andrew's, who left Scotland in 1532, to escape the persecution to which he was exposed in consequence of adopting the principles of the early reformers, describes the Cowgate thus :\u2014\" Infiniti viculi, qui omnes excelsis sunt ornati \u00e6dibus, sicut et Via Vaccarum ; in qua habitant patricii et senatores urbis, et in qua sunt principum regni palatia, ubi nihil est humile aut rusticum, sed omnia magnifica.\"    "},{"title":"Royal Edinburgh; Her Saints, Kings, Prophets and Poets","author":"Oliphant, Mrs. (Margaret)","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/25701","placename":"Pleasance","snippet":"Towards the east, and gradually becoming as important and busy as the High Street itself, though outside the series of towers which guarded the city gate, lay the long line of the Court suburb, the lofty and noble Canongate descending towards the abbey and palace, where all that was splendid in Scotland congregated around the gay and gallant King. Outside the Netherbow Port, striking out in opposite directions, was the road which led to the seaport of Leith and that which took its name from the great Kirk of Field, St. Mary's Wynd, a pleasant walk along the outside of the fortifications to the great monastery on its plateau, with the Pleasance, a name suggestive of all freshness and greenery and rural pleasure, at its feet. Inside the town, between the castle gates and those of the city, were the crowded habitations of a mediaeval town, the only place where business could be carried on in safety, or rich wares exhibited, or money passed from hand to hand.

The knights of St John of Jerusalem, who succeeded to the forfeited possessions of the Templars, it is well-known held lands in almost every shire in Scotland, and claimed a jurisdiction, even within the capital, over certain tenements built on their ground, some of which, now remaining in the Grassmarket, still bear the name of Temple Lands.
