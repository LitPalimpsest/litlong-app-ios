All these curiosities were bought by the late Mr E. Robertson of the Commercial Bank, who had been educated  in Heriot's Hospital, and by him presented to the governors, who ordered them to be carefully deposited and preserved in the house, where they now remain. George Heriot's shop was only about seven feet square ! Yet his ma^er.

Scaife and Willis, though the best natured and most skilful tailors  in being, ought not to send accounts to gentlemen whose breeches they had made without pockets capable of holding them, and that therefore he was under the necessity of employing their well-intentioned  letter in lighting his pipe.
