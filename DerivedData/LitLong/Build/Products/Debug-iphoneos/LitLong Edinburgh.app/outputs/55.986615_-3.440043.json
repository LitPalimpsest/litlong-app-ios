Descending on Duddingstone, you find it retired, low-lying, sunshiny, umbrageous ; a place in which in summer you may expect plenty of dust in the narrow streets, plenty of drowsy bees around the double-flowered white and purple stocks in the gardens, plenty of flies buzzing in the sunny parlour windows.

Get some painter of genius, like Andrew Wilson, or William Allan, or John Watson Gordon, or Hugh Williams, or Alexander Nasmyth, or Mr. Thomson of Duddingstone, to come sauntering out with his portfolio, and take up his abode for a few days in your friendly house, strolling about with you during the forenoons among the banks and braes, and beautifying the paper during the evenings with fair creations of taste and fancy, prophetic of the future beauties and glories that shall ere long be overshadowing your estate.

While at Dailly he distributed landscapes amongst his friends; at Duddingstone he accepted payment. The first picture was sold for fifteen guineas ; and the artist, it is said, was so startled by the mighty sum, that it was only when Mr Williams, the delineator of Greek scenery, whom he consulted  on the subject, told him that the work was worth three times as much, that he could comfortably  consign the coins to his breeches pocket.

Turner was frequently at the manse, and we all know the story how when the minister took the brzisqiie painter into his studio and showed him his works, he called out, \"You beat me in frames, Thomson  ! \" On another occasion, at Duddingstone, when Francis Grant and Mr Horsman, M.P.> were present.

As a clergyman, he was much esteemed by his parishioners, consisting  mainly of well-to-do folks who lived in villas, small market -gardeners who brought their produce into Edinburgh, and washerwomen who worked for the inhabitants of the city, washing  the clothes in the loch, and bleaching and drying them on the slopes of Arthur's Seat, where they caught the scent of the broom.
