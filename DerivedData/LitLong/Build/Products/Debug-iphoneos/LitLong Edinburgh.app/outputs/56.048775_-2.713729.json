These were maintained at HumeCastle, at the Tower of Edgerhope, or Edgerstane,near the source of the Jed, upon the ridge of theSoltra Hills, at Dunbar, Dunpender (or TrapraineJLaw, North Berwick Law, and other eminences;and their light was a signal for the Scottish forcesto assemble at Edinburgh and Haddington, abandoning to waste and pillage all the southern counties.2 Till the very last occasion of hostility betweenEngland and Scotland, this mode of defensive warwas resorted to in the latter kingdom. Cromwellfound the Borders in that desolate situation in hiscampaign of 1650; and, had it not been for themisjudged zeal of the Presbyterian ministers, whourged David Lesley to give battle at Dunbar,he must have made a disastrous and disgracefulretreat.3    "},{"title":"John and Betty's Scotch history visit,","author":"Williamson, Margaret.

Back they whirled to the town, passing  North Berwick Law, a pointed hill rising from the fields like a giant ant-hill, and following  the road along the cliffs, dotted by villas and small hotels. North Berwick is a charming place with attractive shops, many villas, hotels, and an excellent golf course close by the sea, like that of St. Andrews.    "}]
