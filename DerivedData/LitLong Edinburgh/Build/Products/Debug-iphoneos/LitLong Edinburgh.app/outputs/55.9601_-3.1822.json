At length he got to Leith pier ; but his landing gave him no pleasure : he was still haunted with the notion that he would encounter more mischances ; and he hurried up Leith Walk, passing old friends whom he was afraid to speak to. Arrived at the foot of Leith Wynd, he made a detour which brought him to the foot of Halkerston's Wynd, up which he ascended, debouching into the High Street.

Up the stone gully of Leith Walk, when they came to cross it, the breeze made a rush and set the flames of the street-lamps quavering ; and when at last they mounted to the Royal Terrace, where Captain Mackenzie lived, a great salt freshness came in their faces from the sea. These phases of the walk remained written on John's memory, each emphasised by the touch of that light hand on his arm; and behind all these aspects of the nocturnal city he saw, in his mind's eye, a picture of the lighted drawing-room at home where he had sat talking with Flora; and his father, from the other end, had looked on with a kind and ironical smile.

We met with the greatest attention and civility wherever we stopped ; got a good broiled fowl for dinner on the road ; and were finally set down in excellent quarters, at the Bull's Head, at the top of Leith Walk. As I was more than in time for my engagement at BamfF, where my friends at present were, \u2014 I determined, instead of proceeding by diligence or chaise, to go to Aberdeen by sea, and lay out the difference of expense in a few days' residence in Edinburgh, in order to see all I could get access to in that classically interesting capital.
