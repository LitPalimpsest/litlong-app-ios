With numerous illustrations, etc","author":"Morford, Henry.","year":"1867-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-002547751","placename":"Prestonfield House","snippet":"Across that valley, yonder, Duddingston hamlet and its sleepy little Loch ; behind it, crowning the hill, the ruins of Craig-Millar Castle, once the residence of Queen Mary ; and still behind another hill, with the Duke of Buccleugh's Castle of Dalkeith, the finest in Scotland, just showing the peep of a turret or two. A little further on and coming round towards the city again, s'ill beyond the valley\u2014half a mi'e away, brown-roofed and yellow-walled, the house of the Laird of Dumbiedykes, of Scott's \" Heart of Mid-Lothian ;\" and near it Prestonfield House, with its magnificent circus and stables, renowned in the sporting history of the North. And then, as we circled still further, the Old Tower rising ahead, crowned with the Castle on its height, which seems to have the same faculty as No're Dame and the Arc d' Etoile at Paris, of thrusting up a prominent point everywhere and being seen from all directions.
