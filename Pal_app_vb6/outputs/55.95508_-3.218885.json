[{"title":"Memoir of James Wyld of Gilston, and his family","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/95743043","placename":"Buckingham Terrace","snippet":"Among them was Ada Balfour, who has ever since, during her laborious life at Inverleith Row assisting her father, been one of our most constant and favourite friends, and who has lately (1888) been married to Dr John Cleland, Professor  of Anatomy in Glasgow University. After Miss Simson removed to Buckingham Terrace, Jessie had an English teacher, Mr Smith, an enthusiastic man, bent on all learning, ancient and modern ; and Jessie got inspired by him with a love, not only of modern literature, but of ancient and antiquarian  learning, and was led to read translations of the works of many old authors, some of them more curious than useful. Mr Smith was so glad to find a pupil of this kind, that he tried to persuade  her to devote her life to literature.    "}]
