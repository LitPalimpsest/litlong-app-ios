At the Haymarket there were simply no bounds to what was said in the greenroom. One night I remember gathering up my skirts (we were, I think, playing \"The Rivals\" at the time), making a curtsey, as Mr. Chippendale, one of the best actors in old comedy I ever knew, had taught me, and sweeping out of the room with the famous line from another Sheridan play: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I leave my character behind me!\"    "},{"title":"The Story of My Life; Recollections and Reflections","author":"Terry, Ellen","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/12326","placename":"Haymarket","snippet":"It was not a new play, but the public at once began to crowd to see it, and I have heard that it brought Mr. Hare L30,000. My part, Lilian Vavasour, had been played in the original production by Mrs. Kendal, but it had been written for me by Tom Taylor when I was at the Haymarket, and it suited me very well. The revival was well acted all round.    "},{"title":"Forty years on the stage :","author":"Barnes, J.

I saw him make his first appearance in London at the Haymarket in the 'sixties in a farce.

I had played Gertrude Howard in \"The Little Treasure\" during the stock season at Bristol, and when Mr. Buckstone wanted to do the piece at the Haymarket, he was told about me. I was fifteen at this time, and my sense of humor was as yet ill-developed.

The well-known Cats' Opera was advertised in the Haymarket ; the horse, the dog, the monkeys, and the cats went through their several parts with uncommon applause, to crowded houses, and in a few days Bisset found himself possessed of nearly a thousand pounds to reward his ingenuity.
