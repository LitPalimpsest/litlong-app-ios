Abercromby Place, though not begun till about 1809, was the first instance in which the straight line was voluntarily departed from. People used to go and stare at the curved street.

God did not reveal that He had punished the tradesmen and mechanics of the High Street for the musical sins of the lawyers and landowners of Abercromby Place and Charlotte Square ; nor could any natural relation be established between the oratorios in the Parliament House or the concerts in the Theatre Royal, and the conflagrations opposite the Cross or at the top of the Tron Church steeple. All that could be proven in the case were the facts of the festival and of the fires ; and the further fact, that, so far as could be ascertained, there was no visible connexion between them, and that it was not the people who had joined in the one that had suffered from the others.

Margaret Alison had taken lodgings for us in Abercromby Place finely built, with hanging shrubbery garden, and the house as delightful as the situation.

First of all, I took a stroll through the older aristocratic parts of the City\u2014namely, St. Andrew's Square, George Street, Queen Street, and Abercromby Place. Then I called upon my friend, The Hon. Mr. C , but he was out; and then I sauntered into the High Street, where the Heralds were reading the Queen's Proclamation of her neutrality in the war between Spain and Chili.

This worthy man, whose wife was as warm-hearted towards the old friends of her husband as he was himself, had speedily accomplished an acquaintance with the faniily of Douglas Falconar, the best beloved of his youthful companions; and the young people and his household being mutually deliglrfe'd with each other, they were often together.. The colonel and his lady enjoyed bringing their friends about them, in a quiet and unpremeditated way; and, remembering with youthful freshness of feeling their own early and long-tried attachment, they had a special pleasure in eifecting meetings between people whom they suspected of any lurking partiality for each other's society.
