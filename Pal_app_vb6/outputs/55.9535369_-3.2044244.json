[{"title":"Around the clock in Europe :","author":"Howell, Charles Fish","year":"1912-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=loc.ark:\/13960\/t6737fv0w","placename":"The Honours","snippet":"In the great \"historic mile\" of High Street, lifting gradually from Holyrood to this rugged elevation, one feels the illusion of an enormous scornful finger extended dramatically westward toward the traditional rival, Glasgow. There is no need to see Highland regiments drilling on its broad esplanade, or to enter its sally-port or penetrate the dungeons in its rocky depths to have confidence that the royal regalia of \"The Honours of Scotland\" are safe enough here, on the red cushions in their iron cage. One enters, and there settles upon him a feeling of sharing in every grim tradition since the doughty days \"when gude King Robert rang.\"    "}]
