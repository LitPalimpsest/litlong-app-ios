These two divisions occupy by much the larger portion of the fore and middle grounds of the prospect ; but along the western flanks of the Pentlands and the northern slopes of the Lammermoor range we may catch a glimpse, on the skirts of the landscape, of an older system, the Old Red Sandstone ; and the Lanimermoors themselves, with a minute though fundamental portion of the Pentland group, belong to the yet older Silurian system, that emphatically ancient group of rocks during the deposition of which life, animal and vegetable, seems to have had its commencement on our planet Our view from Arthur Seat thus includes at least representative members of the three prevailing systems of the great Palaeozoic division, the Silurian or Lower Palaeozoic system, the Old Red or Middle Palaeozoic system, and the Carboniferous or Upper Palaeozoic system. It includes, however, yet another group of rocks, rocks that occur in proportions so large, and present outlines so striking, that the scene possesses scarce a prominent feature which it does not owe to them.

On the south at the foot of the hill, the burghers' suburb, where the merchants, lawyers, and even some of the nobles had their houses and gardens, lay outside the walls in the sunshine, protected only by the soft summits of the Braid and Pentland hills: what is now the Cowgate, not a savoury quarter, being then the South Side, the flowery and sheltered faubourg in which all who could afford the freedom of a country residence while still close to the town, expanded into larger life, as the wealthy tradesfolk of all ages, and persons bound to a centre of occupation and duty, always love to do. Towards the east, and gradually becoming as important and busy as the High Street itself, though outside the series of towers which guarded the city gate, lay the long line of the Court suburb, the lofty and noble Canongate descending towards the abbey and palace, where all that was splendid in Scotland congregated around the gay and gallant King.
