I found the bed of shells to which he referred in the upper part of his brick-field, a few yards from the road which passes between the Portobello railway station and the old Roman way familiarly known as the Fishwives' Causeway. It occurs at the depth of from three to five feet from the surface of the brick-clay, and from about six to eight feet from the surface of the soil; and when I last examined it, it measured, from where it first appears in the section, to the point where the excavation terminates and it disappears in the bank, exactly fifty yards.
