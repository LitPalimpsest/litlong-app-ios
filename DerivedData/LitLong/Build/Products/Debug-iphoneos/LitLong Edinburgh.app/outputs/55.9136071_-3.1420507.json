The first of these presented itself at the summit of one of the Ochills; audthe second, which was, in fact, but a nearer viewof a portion of the first, was enjoyed ou attainingthe western shoulder of the hill of Moredun, or Moncreiff. This view from Moncreill7that which, it issaid, made the Romans exclaim that they had foundanother field of Mars on the bank of another Tiber)now opens to the traveller in a less abrupt andstriking manuer than formerly, but it still retainsmany of those features which Pennant has so warmlyeulogized.
