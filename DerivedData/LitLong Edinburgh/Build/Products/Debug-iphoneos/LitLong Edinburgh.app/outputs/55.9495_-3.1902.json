The strains of music that in the distance sounded so martial and triumphant we recognised in a moment as 'Abide with me,' and never did the fine old tune seem more majestic than when it marked a measure for the steady tramp, tramp, tramp, of those soldierly feet.

From the period of the erection of this building in the reign of Queen Mary, the Scottish Parliaments and the College of Justice assembled there, until their sittings were transferred to the fine hall which still remains in Parliament Square, though so strangely disguised externally by its modern facing. On the desertion of the New Tolbooth by the Scottish Estates and Courts of Law, it was exclusively devoted to the deliberations of the Civic councillors, until the erection of the Royal Exchange provided enlarged accomodation for the Council.

Between the pillars that, before the great fires in Edinburgh, formed the base of the high tenement standing there, and St. Giles' Church, being the entrance into the Parliament Square, and between St. Giles' and the Exchange buildings, the full moon threw a stream of light, filling both the openings, and leaving all above and below involved in deep shade. It was the moon's rays thus thrown upon the groimd, and reaching up to the second windows of the houses, that formed the waU which the two ofiicials observed.

We had walked some twenty miles that day, the third day of our journey from Ecclefeehan ; my companion one \"Tom Small,\" who had already been to college last year, and was thought to be a safe guide and guardian to me.

Whatever be the reason, the annual church service has been abandoned ; the royal almoner's name no longer appears in the list of her Majesty's Scottish household ; and the whole business is now managed in the most matter-of-fact and common-place style at the Exchequer Chambers in the Parliament Square, not far from the ancient scene of this annual distribution of the royal bounty.

I soon saw that Henry Gering had been correct in his estimate of the townsfolk, for the rabble were very fierce, and I had not been a week at my work when there was a bloody sight in the Parliament Square about some trifle or other.

What streets we went through I don't the least recollect, but have some saint image of St. Giles's High Kirk, and of the Luckenbooths there, with their strange little ins and outs, and eager old women in miniature shops of combs, shoe-laces, and trifles ; still fainter image, if any whatever, of the sublime horso statue in Parliament Square hard by.
