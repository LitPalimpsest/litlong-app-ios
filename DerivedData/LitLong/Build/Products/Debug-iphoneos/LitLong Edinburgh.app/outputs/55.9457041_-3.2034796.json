The Point road, on the other side of the river and commencement of bay (New Bedford district), is quite a popular drive for all classes, and this pleasant esplanade of some three miles around is much enjoyed in fine weather. About midway of the Point is a large fortress, in good condition, with numbers of cannon and a quantity of ammunition in the citadel's enclosure.    "}]
