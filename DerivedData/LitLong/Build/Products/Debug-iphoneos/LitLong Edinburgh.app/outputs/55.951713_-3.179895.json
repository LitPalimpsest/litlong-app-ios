In the Canongate Churchyard, not a stone's- throw from St. John's Street, lies good Scottish dust in plenty ; but, in Mr. Fairfield's eyes, the chief interest of the place was owing to the fact that John Ballantyne was buried there, and Sir Walter had stood at the open grave with Lockhart at his side, and had whispered, as he marked the sun gleam on the walls and towers of the Calton Hill, \" I feel as if there would be less sunshine  for me from this day forth \".
