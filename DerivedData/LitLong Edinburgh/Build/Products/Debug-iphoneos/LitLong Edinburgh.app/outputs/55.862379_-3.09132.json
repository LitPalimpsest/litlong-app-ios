[{"title":"Notes by the Way; or, what I saw in my rambles","author":"Higginson, H.

The surroundings of Edinburgh are very lovely, and there are many interesting places within easy distance worth seeing, such as Leith, Trinity, and Newhaven, celebrated for their fish and fishwives, who have a picturesque costume like the Stirling women\u2014a striped skirt and large blue cloak, with a creel of fish on their backs, and a peculiar cry of \" Caller rue! caller haddy!\" Also Granton, Portobello, Musselburgh, Roslin (where is the famous Roslin Chapel), and Hawthornden, Dalkeith, Newbattle Abbey, Dalhousie Castle, Hopetown House, and Queensferry. Having spent a very happy time in Edinburgh, where I made personal friends of Sir James Symes, Professor Bennett, and Christison (at whose houses I dined and spent some pleasant evenings), and with the family of Dr. Watson, it was with regret I said farewell to the old University, where I had passed some very pleasant days in taking my M.D. at the hands of Sir David Brewster, who placed a large cap\u2014 called \u00c6sculapius' cap\u2014on my head, and with a few words pronounced me Doctor of Medicine, I being attired in academical costume.
