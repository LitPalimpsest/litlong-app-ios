For the most part, the old masters arekept apart from the modern; although Dr. Brown, inhis 'Notes on Art,' in his Bor\u0153 Subseciv\u0153,* where heis speaking of the huddling together of sacred and profane subjects in picture galleries, quotes an instancefrom this Gallery of a copy of Titian's 'Ariadne at Naxos'being hung immediately above ' Wilkie's sacred sketchof John Knox administering the Sacrament in CalderHouse.' It is to be regretted that this latter picture, whichis unfinished\u2014Wilkie having been engaged upon it justbefore setting out for the East\u2014should be the onlyspecimen that the Gallery possesses of Scotland's mostcharacteristic national painter, f The picture has beenwell engraved in ' The Art Journal.'
