As the \"last of the troubadours\" he has won for himself a permanent place in literature. He was tlie son of a poor tailor, and was himself a barber, like Allan Ramsay. He continued to work at his trade to the end, despite many inducements to abandon it and to quit hU rural home for the city. His answer to all who wished him to change his mode of life, was : \" I shave for a living  and I sing for pleasure \" His poems became popular in spite of the fact that they were written in a language which lias been long disused except by the peasantry of the south of France. The Provencal was the language of the troubadours, and its popularity was revived for a brief space by Jasmin in his songs of the pastoral delights and traditions of his compatriots. The following is an admirable translation of one of his most pathetic stories (Mttltro L'liioucento) by Professor Henry Coppee, of the Pennsylvania University. The incidents in this little drama commenced in 1798, at Lafitte, a pretty hamlet situated 011 the banks of the Lot, near Clairac, and terminated  in 180'J. At this last period, Martha, bereftof her reason, esc.iped from the village, and was often afterwards  seen in the streets of Agen, an object of public pity, begging her bread, and flying in terror from the children, who cried outafter her : \"MaLtro, ungouldat.'\" (Martha, a soldier!) The author confesses that more than all others, in his childhood he pursued poor Martha with his sarcasms: he little dreamed that one day his muse, inspired by the wretched lot of the poor idiot, would owe to her one of his most exquisite creations. Martha died in 1834.]    "},{"title":"Penelope's progress :","author":"Wiggin, Kate Douglas Smith","year":"1898-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t5t728p7f","placename":"Allan","snippet":"\" Willie brewed a peck o' maut, An' Rob an' Allan cam to pree ; \"    "},{"title":"Penelope's progress :","author":"Wiggin, Kate Douglas Smith","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t90864w9z","placename":"Allan","snippet":"\" Willie brewed a peck o' maut, An' Rob an' Allan cam to pree ; \"    "},{"title":"Europe from May to December,","author":"Williams, Rudolph.","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=loc.ark:\/13960\/t6640dz3n","placename":"Allan","snippet":"Old Allan Bane foretold your plight,    "},{"title":"Old world scenes \/","author":"Williams, Charles","year":"1867-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=loc.ark:\/13960\/t9z03n92z","placename":"Allan","snippet":"The residence of Allan \"Ramsay is preserved with much care, and the gardens are kept in neat order, but have been entirely remodeled, and are not thrown open to the public.
