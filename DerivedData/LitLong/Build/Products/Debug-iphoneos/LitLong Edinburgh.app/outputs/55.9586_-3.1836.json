The quaint old house of Pilrig stands a little backfrom Leith Walk, the date on it is 1638; and the text inscribed on itsdoor-stone, 'For we know, that if our earthly house of this tabernaclewere dissolved we have a building of God, an house not made with handseternal in the heavens,' is a fitting motto for a race whose firstprominent ancestor was that James Balfour of Reformation times, who notonly was a cousin of Melville the Reformer, but who married one of theMelville family. This double tie to those so entwined with the very lifeof that great period in Scotland's history brought Mr James Balfour intovery close communion with such men as Erskine of Dun, the Rev. JohnDurie, and many others of the Reforming ministers and gentlemen, withwhom a member of the Pilrig family, the late James Balfour-Melville,Esq., W.S., in his interesting pamphlet dealing with his family says,that his ancestor had much godly conversation and communing.
