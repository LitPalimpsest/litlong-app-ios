On the back of the pulpit is the Tree of Knowledge, full of the fruit, and exquisitely wrought : the canopy is upheld by Angels ; its drapery of wood carving, almost real, is held up by flying Cherubs^who seem to hang in air ; and on the top, is the full length Virgin, erect, holding out a cross, and at her feet the infant Jesus, with his foot on the serpent's head, beautifully carved. At every point, are peacocks, birds, and other animals of life size and in natural positions.
