The old concert gentlemen said that his compositions  wanted the solidity and full harmony of Handel and Corelli ; and when the celebrated leader \u2014 the elder Cramer \u2014 visited St Cecilia's Hall, and played a spirited charming overture of Haydn's, an old amateur next to whom I was seated asked me, \" Whase music is that, now?\" \" Haydn's, sii-,\" said I. \" Poor newfangled stuff,\" he replied ; \" I hope I shall never hear it again ! \" Many years have since rolled away, and rnark what some among us now say : \u2014 A friend calling lately on an old lady much in the fashionable circle of society, heard her give directions  to the pianist who was teaching her nieces to bring them some new and fashionable pieces of music, but no more of the unfashionable compositions of Haydn ! Alas for those ladies whose taste in music is regulated by fashion, and who do not know that the music of Haydn is the admiration  and delight of all the real lovers and judges of the art in Europe !

He used to tell that, on alighting at Ramsay's Inn, opposite the Cowgate Port, his first impression of the city was so unfavourable, that he was on the point of leaving it again, without further acquaintance, and was only prevented  from doing so by the solicitations of his fellow- traveller, who was not so much alarmed at the dingy and squalid appearance of this part of Auld Reekie.* He was first employed at St Cecilia's Hall, where the concerts were attended by all the ' rank, beauty, and fashion ' of which Edinburgh could then boast, and where, besides the professional performers, many amateurs of great musical skill and enthusiasm, such as Mr Tytler of Woodhouselee, t were pleased to exhibit themselves, for the entertain-    "},{"title":"The Uncommon Appeal of Clouds","author":"McCall Smith, Alexander","year":null,"url":null,"placename":"St Cecilia'S Hall","snippet":"They walked to St Cecilia's Hall.

The hall was built on purpose at the foot of Niddry's Wynd, by a number of public-spirited noblemen and gentlemen ; and the expense of the concerts was defrayed  by about two hundred subscribers, paying two or three guineas each annually ; and so respectable was the institution considered, that upon the death of a member, there were generally several applications for the vacancy, as is now the case with the Caledonian Hunt.
