If tliere be sermons in stones, what think ye of the hynnis and psalms, matin and vesper, of the lark, wdio at heaven's gate sings \u2014 of the wren, wdio pipes her thanksgivings as the slant sunbeam shoots athwart the mossy portal of the cave, in whose fretted roof she builds her nest above the waterfall ! In cave-roof ? Yea \u2014 we have seen it so \u2014 just beneath the cornice.    "}]
