Charlie wore his learning lightly, but everybody in the room knew that if there was one man who could identify a glass of anonymous amber liquid and attribute it to any one of the country's distilleries, name the man who blended it, and talk at length about the history of the glen from which it came, then it was Charlie.

Certainly it had been the custom for years for the cottars to keep up their meagre steadings, for which purpose they were welcome to obtain wood free of charge from the Laird's saw-mill on the Quaich.
