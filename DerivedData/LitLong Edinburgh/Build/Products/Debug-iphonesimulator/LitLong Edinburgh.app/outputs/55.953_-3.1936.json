[{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"South St David Street","snippet":"Hume appears to have derived great pleasure from the magnificent prospect which his elevated residence secured to him ; yet, although he writes to Dr Robertson in 1759, \" I have the strangest reluctance to change places,\" he was, nevertheless, one of the earliest to emigrate beyond the North Loch. In 1770, he commenced building his new house, which was the first erected in South St David Street, and in which he died. The old dwelling, however, was not immediately abandoned to the plebeian population ; Boswell, as we have seen, succeeded him, and he was followed in its occupancy by the Lady Wallace, Dowager, relict of Sir Thomas Wallace of Cragie.3 The floor below Hume's house was the property of Andrew Macdowal, Esq., advocate, author of the \" Institutional Law of Scotland,\" a ponderous mass of legal learning, in three folio volumes.
