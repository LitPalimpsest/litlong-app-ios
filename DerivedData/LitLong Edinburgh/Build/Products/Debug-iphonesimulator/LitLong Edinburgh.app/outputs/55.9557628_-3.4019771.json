[{"title":"Memoir of James Wyld of Gilston, and his family","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/95743043","placename":"Kirkliston","snippet":"As my family of six children, namely, three sons and three daughters, were then growing up, I bought my present beautifully situated house, No. 19 Inverleith Row, and removed there in June of that year. A year after our being settled in Edinburgh, I received one morning an unexpected visit from Robert Stewart of Ingleston, proprietor of the large distillery at Kirkliston, who came reminding me of a written offer I had made him some years previous, to sell my distillery for ^5000, and he offered now to give this sum. I may mention that my father had, a few years previous, conveyed to me the whole Queensferry property.    "}]
