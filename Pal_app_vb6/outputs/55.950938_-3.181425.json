A view of the largest apartment is given in the Abbotsford edition of the Waverley Novels, under the name of \" Hall of the Knights of St John, St John's Close, Canongate.'\" We have failed in every attempt to obtain any clue to the early history of the building, which tradition has associated with this ancient order of soldier-priests.

A little further eastward, is St John's Close, an ancient alley, bearing over an old doorwav within it, the inscription in bold Roman characters :\u2014the . lord . is \u2022 only . my . svport. Immediately adjoining this is St John Street, a broad and handsome thoroughfare, forming the boldest scheme of civic improvement effected in Edinburgh before the completion of the North Bridge, and the rival works on the south side of the town.
