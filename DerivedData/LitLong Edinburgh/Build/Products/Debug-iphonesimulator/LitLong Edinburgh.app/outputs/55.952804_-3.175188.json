[{"title":"Memoir of James Wyld of Gilston, and his family","author":null,"year":null,"url":"http:\/\/digital.nls.uk\/95743043","placename":"St Thomas's Hospital","snippet":"The mother and her eldest daughter Edith, notwithstanding these trials, are ever the patterns of cheerful hopefulness. Edith has been for three years in a nurse's home in London, and being educated as a nurse probationer at St Thomas's Hospital, she has now been sent as an out-door nurse and visitor to a district of the mining population at Bishop Auckland, near Durham. Small, slender, but as I have said, beaming with cheerfulness and hopefulness, there ever seems to me in that face and heart, the potentiality, if God preserves her, of endless help and comfort to the suffering fellow-creatures to whom she has devoted herself.
