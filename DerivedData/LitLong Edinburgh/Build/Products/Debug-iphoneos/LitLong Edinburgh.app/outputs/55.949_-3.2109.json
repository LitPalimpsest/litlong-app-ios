The house Number 3 Walker Street, which he took for the winter of 1826, and which he described as comfortable and convenient, stands to-day as it stood in his time, and looks none the worse for wear ; but the lodgings at 6 St. David's Street, which he went to in May, 1826, just after the crash the place where \" the insects were voracious,\" and the cheese was a \" choke-dog concern \" are now no more ; and when we sought out \" Mrs. Jobson' s house,\" 6 Shandwick Place, his last fixed residence in Edinburgh, we felt grave doubts as to its authenticity.

Very near this house, he was told a few days after he took possession, dwelt the aged mother of his first love ; and he expressed to his friend Mrs. Skene a wish that she should carry him to renew an acquaintance which seems to have been interrupted from the period of his youthful romance.
