Every kind of spiritual disinfectantwas put in requisition ; chosen ministers weresummoned out of Edinburgh and prayed bythe hour; pious neighbours sat up all nightmaking a noise of psalmody ; but Satan mindedthem no more than the wind about the hilltops ; and it was only after years of persecution, that he left the Hunter's Tryst inpeace to occupy himself with the remainder ofmankind. What with General Kay, and thewhite lady, and this singular visitation, theneighbourhood offers great facilities to themakers of sun-myths ; and without exactlycasting in one's lot with that disenchantingschool of writers, one cannot help hearing agood deal of the winter wind in the last story.

Suppose that Ifound it (and the chances in that fog were perhaps against me),would Alexander Hendry, aroused from his bed, be likely toextend his hospitality to a traveller with no more luggage thana Paisley shawl?
