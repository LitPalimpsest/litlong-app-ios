It is a large price for a mere whistle, especially, too, as undoubted judges of such articles say it is a whistle that won't blow.

And the Burns Monument, regarded simply as a fact, should be at least equally sacred. It is a greatly more wonderful fact than the statue of Charles.

Above it, just across the road, and carefully enclosed, the Burns Monument rests on an eminence. It is not a beautiful sculpture, despite its elaborateness; it has not the significance that would make it even approach the adequate; it has none of the humanity, none of the poetic personality, that characterize the bronze figure in the square at Ayr.
