It is Scotland now, and as we pass through the storied Border we keep the ocean almost constantly in view, \u2014 losing it for a little while at Dunbar, but finding it again at Drem, \u2014till, past the battlefield of Prestonpans, and past the quaint villages of Cockenzie and Musselburgh and the villas of Portobello, we come slowly to a pause in the shadow of Arthur's Seat, where the great lion crouches over the glorious city of Edinburgh.

A hundred years ago, the houses thus marked were held as part of the barony of Drem in Haddingtonshire, the baron of which used to hold courts in them occasionally ; and here were harboured many persons not free of the city corporations, to the great annoyance of the adherents of local monopoly. At length, the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1747 extinguished this little barony, but not certain other legal rights connected with the Templar Lands, which, however, it might be more troublesome to explain than advantageous to know.

On reaching the station-house at Drem, I transferred myself from the railway vehicle to an omnibus that plies between the station and North Berwick ; and we drove across the country. A coach-top is not quite the place from which the geology of a district may be most carefully studied ; and yet it has its advantages too.    "}]
