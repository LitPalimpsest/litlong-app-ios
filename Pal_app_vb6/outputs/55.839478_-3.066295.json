The manor-house of Arniston had not then been built ; the Shank was a small manor-house, as was also Castleton, with its tower and chapel ; but Arniston would seem, from the sketch of the buildings on the map, to have been little more than a farmhouse  and offices. The river banks of both the Esk and Gore were covered with wood, as were likewise the banks of the Castleton burn.

No trees are shown on the open country northwards from Arniston ; but as none are shown around the yards and enclosures of the different farms, where they probably existed, the absence of isolated trees may be due to the hasty manner in which the map was drawn, describing only the boundaries which were likely to be required in the litigation with the owner of Shank. In the same way no roads or tracks are shown, with the exception of that from Edinburgh to Carrington, and thence by Castleton towards the Moorfoot Hills, although others are known to have then existed.

The Shank tenants complained that their ancient rights were curtailed, while the Arniston tenants were resolved upon tilling their land without molestation a  quarrel which, as will be seen further on, was terminated in the next generation by the owner of Arniston buying up the servitudes exeix-ised by outside  tenants over his estate. Of the purchasers among whom the old Templar barony of Ballintrodo had been divided, George Dundas and his wife seem to have been the wealthiest and most active.
