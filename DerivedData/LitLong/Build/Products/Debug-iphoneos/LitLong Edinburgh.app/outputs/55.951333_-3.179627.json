I know, however, that we identified Moray House and Huntly House, and the Tolbooth, and that we sauntered awhile among the tombs in the Canongate churchyard. I feel sure, too, that we strolled into White Horse Close and inspected the building, which was once the White Horse Inn, and that the guide-books enabled us to identify it as the lodging-place of Waverley and Fergus Mclvor.
