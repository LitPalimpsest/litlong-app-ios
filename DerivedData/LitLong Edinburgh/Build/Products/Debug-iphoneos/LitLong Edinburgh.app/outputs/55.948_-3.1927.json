Some curious anecdotes of Tam o' the Cowgate, as the King facetiously styled his favourite, are preserved in the Traditions of Edinburgh, derived from the descendants of the sagacious old peer, and many others that are recorded of him suffice to confirm the character he enjoyed for shrewd wit and eminent ability. Directly opposite to this, a building characterised by very remarkable architectural features, was peculiarly worthy of the attention of the local antiquary.

Doubtless the erection of the latter building, where all the great civic and national assemblies of the period took place, must have had considerable influence in leading to the abandonment of the old churchyard of St Giles as a place of burial.
