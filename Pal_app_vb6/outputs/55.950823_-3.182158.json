[{"title":"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time","author":"Wilson, Daniel","year":"1848-01-01","url":"https:\/\/historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk\/bl-003943634","placename":"Weir's Close","snippet":"Such are the associations with one little fragment of the Bow that still exists, our remaining descriptions must be, alas ! of things that were, and that appeared so hideous to the refined tastes of our civic reformers, that they have not grudged the cost of i?400,000 to have them removed. Directly facing the low archway leading into Major Weir's Close was the Old Assembly Rooms, bearing the date 1602, and described in its ancient titledeeds as \" that tenement of land on the west side of the transe of the Over Bow, betwixt the land of umqle Lord Ruthven on the north, and the King's auld wall on the south parts.\" Lord Ruthven's land, which appears in our engraving of the Old Assembly Rooms, was an ancient timber-fronted tenement, similar to those we have described in the Castlehill.
