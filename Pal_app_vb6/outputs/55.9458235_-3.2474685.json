But here he was on Regent Terrace; there was nothing to prevent him going round the end of the hill, and looking from without on the Mackenzies' house.    "},{"title":"Works of R. L. Stevenson.

Queensferry Street lies something off the direct road to Murrayfield. But then there is the hilly cross-road that passes by the valley of the Leith and the Dean Cemetery; and Queensferry Street is on the way to that.    "},{"title":"Works of R. L. Stevenson.

But his master was not there; he was staying, it appeared, at the house in Murrayfield; and though the butler would have been glad enough to have taken his place and given all the news of the family, John, struck with a little chill, was eager to be gone.

I often think, I assure you, of the pleasant days I used to pass at Murrayfield; and often reflect, with lively, though indeed inadequate gratitude, of the kindness I have received from your family. Tell Mrs. Murray that this is the case ; I am anxious she should know it: as she once treated me with kindness, which I construed into regard, I should anxiously wish to preserve the esteem of so respectable a parent of the friend whom I love most.

Did you see a silly tale, John Nicholson's Predicament, 1 or some such name, in which I made free with your home at Murrayfield ? There is precious little sense in it, but it might amuse. Cassell's published it in a thing called Yule-Tide years ago, and nobody that ever I heard of read or has ever seen YuleTide.    "}]
