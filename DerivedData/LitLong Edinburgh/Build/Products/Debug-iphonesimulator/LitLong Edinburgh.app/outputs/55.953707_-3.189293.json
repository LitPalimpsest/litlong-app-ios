From old charters preserved in the Register House it appears that that property was held by payment to the king of a silver penny upon the Castle Hill of Edinburgh. \" Fourteen years services as Constable, including so memorable a siege, may perhaps account for the silver link between the Wrychtishousis and the Castle Hill.\"1    "},{"title":"Benedict's wanderings, in Ireland, Scotland, Italy and Sicily ...","author":"Dawson, Edward W[alter] [from old catalog]","year":"1873-01-01","url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=loc.ark:\/13960\/t5gb2m817","placename":"Register House","snippet":"Passing through Princes street I runic to the -Register House, a handsome edifice, forming a square of two hundred feet, and containing one hundred apartments for the transaction of business.

A Caallerr owhoo-oo-oo!' rang upon my ear, delivered sharply and anything but musically, but pitched in a high note that ended in a prolonged and smothered bowl. When Coleridge interrogated an old Jew vendor of still older clothes, why he snuffled ' 0 clo!' instead of saying, ' Old clothes !' the Jew is reported to have replied, ' Sir, I can say old clothes distinctly when I so please; but, when you consider the labial difficulties that attend upon the full pronunciation of these two words, when repeated many hundred times in a day, I think you will allow that I save my lungs from considerable and unnecessary fatigue by repeating that contracted form of my cry, which is best known to my customers, instead of adopting that    "},{"title":"The judge,","author":"West, Rebecca","year":null,"url":"http:\/\/babel.hathitrust.org\/cgi\/pt?id=uc2.ark:\/13960\/t91836s7n","placename":"Register House","snippet":"What did they want in a cab anyway?

Walter, as Clerk of Session, had the patronage of several offices in the Register House at Edinburgh, and he appointed Thomas to one of these, by no means so lucrative as others at his disposal, but welcome under the circumstances. Thomas soon after found it convenient to withdraw for a time to the Isle of Man ; and while he was there, the Government introduced a bill, by which his extractor ship, and many other little places of the sort, were to be abolished, the holders receiving some compensation by way of annuity.

The North Bridge was a noble structure, and the newly-built Register House at the other end one of the finest buildings of modern times to the admiring chroniclers of Edinburgh. And the historians and philosophers, the great doctors, the great lawyers, the elegant critics, for whom it was more and more necessary that the ways of access between the old town and the new might be made more easy, presided over and criticised all those wonderful new buildings of classic style and unbroken regularity, and watched the progress of the Earthen Mound, a bold and picturesque expedient which filled up the hollow and made a winding walk between, with interest as warm as that which they took in the lectures and students, the books and researches, which were making their city one of the intellectual centres of the world.

This wretched being, after losing property and credit, and his own senses, in following a valueless phantom, died at last (1817) in Cupar jail, where he was placed by one of his legal creditors.
