Sheep were carried off and slaughtered in the fields ; the larders of gentlemen who, like all men of sense, valued good dinners, were broken into, and turkey and tongue extracted ; bakers were robbed of their flour, provision merchants of their hams; a vessel in the harbour, on the eve of sailing, was lightened of her sea-stock ; one worthy burgher, much in the habit of examining objects in the distance, had his spy-glass stolen, another was denuded of his clothes ; the mansion- house of Seacliff was harried, the farm-house of Scoughall plundered ; and quiet men and respectable women grew nervous over three whole parishes, when they thought of the light-fingered invisibilities that wrought the mischief, and asked what was to come next.
