In this imperfect state the defence reached the Netherbow Port, which divided the city from the Canongate. From this point the wall ran down Leith Wynd, and terminated at the hospital called Paul's Work, connecting itself on that point with the North, or Nor' Loch, so called because it was on the northern side of the city, and its sole defence on that quarter.

In the evidence, it is shown that even a freeman of the capital dared not encroach on the bounds of the Canongate; and that, \" in 1671, the Privy Council fined David Pringle, chirurgeon, for employing one Wood, an unfree barber, to exerce his calling in polling the children's heads in Heriot's Hospital !\"3 In this case Lord Halton seems also to have been left free to employ his own workmen; but the craftsmen were declared warranted in their interference, and therefore free from the charge of rioting.
