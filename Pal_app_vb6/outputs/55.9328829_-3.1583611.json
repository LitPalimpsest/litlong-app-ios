On the western shore we have passed Cameron House (where lives the lineal descendant of Smollett, the historian), Belretiro House, Banuchra Castle, and Arden House, near to which is the entrance to Glenfruin, ' the glen of wailing,' so called from the great battle fought here in 1602, between the Macgregors and Colquhouns, in which the latter clan were well nigh exterminated, while their chief, Alister of Glenstrae, having surrendered on terms, was treacherously hanged. The widows of the slain Colquhouns went to StirUng, and appeared before James the Sixth, each bearing the bloody shirt of her husband displayed on a pike, and demanding vengeance.    "}]
