It is believed to have derived its name from John DingwaU, who was Provost of the neighbouring Collegiate Foundation of Trinity College, and one of the original Judges of the Court of Session on the spiritual side.

They drove into Waterloo Place, posted the letter; and, turning back, swept past the Duty-House on to the North Bridge. Every moment was now tangibly bringing them nearer the trying scene.

He went straight out of the prison, passed along Waterloo Place; and after traversing some of the streets in the New Town, finally entered the office of a certain lawyer named Rackrent.
