At length, Mrs Cockburn had no alternative from sending out to her neighbours to borrow a supply of similar integuments, which was soon procured. There was then such sun in sitting the various savans with suitable substitutes for their own proper gear! Hume, for instance, with a dreadnoug'ht riding-coat, IMonboddo with a shabby old hat, as unlike his own neat chapeau as possible ! In the highest exaltation of spirits did these two men of genius at length proceed homeward along the Potterrow,  Horse Wynd, Assembly Close, &c. making the old echoes merry with their peals of laughter at the strange appearance which they respectively made.

Then it was almost certain that either the Old Town and New Town boys, the Georg-e's Square and Potterrow  boys, the Herioters and the Watsoners, or some other parties accustomed to regard themselves as natural enemies, would meet on some common ground, and fall a-pelting each other. There were hardly anywhere two adjoining streets, but the boys respectively belonging to them would occasionally hold encounters of this kind ; and the animosity assumed a darker tinge if there was any discrepancy of rank or condition between the parties, as was apt to be the case when, for instance, the Old Town lads met the children of the aristocratic streets to the north.
