On the 5th May 1530, for example, \" William Kar oblissis him that he sail nocht be sene into the fische rnerkat, nother byand nor selland fische, vnder the pane of cutting of his lug and bannasing of the toune, hot gif he haif ane horse of his auno till bring fische to the merket till sell vniuersale as vther strangearis dois till our Soucrane Lordis legis.\"\u2014 (Acts and Statutes of the Burgh of Edinburgh, Mait. Misc., vol. ii. p. 101.) At this period the Greyfriars' or Bristo Port appears to have been a usual scene for such judicial terrors. On the 1st July 1530, \" Patrick Gowanlok fleschour, duelland in the Abbot of Melrosis lugying within this toune,\" is banished the town for ever, under pain of death, for harbouring a woman infected with the pestilence ; \" And at the half of his moveablc gudis be applyit to the commoun workis of this toune for his desalt, And als that his seruand woman callit Jonet Cowanc, quhilk is infekkit, for hir conceling the said seiknes, and passand in pilgrimage, scho baiffand the pcstilcns aponc hir, that scho salbe brynt on baith the cheikis and bannist this toune for ever vndcr the pane of clcid.

The Editor has been unable to discover the circumstances under which this curious collection came into the possession of the Faculty of Advocates ; but he thinks it probable that, when the affairs of the Company  were wound up after the Union, and its miscellaneous property was dispersed, the oak press, containing the business.-books of the establishment, was carried from the office, in Bristo Port, across the Cowgate, and deposited in the Advocates Library, as an Institution where it might not unappropriately  be preserved, and which was conveniently near. The collection has been suffered to remain undisturbed in its original repository, except that a large mass of the miscellaneous papers appear to have been ct)llected together, and bound up, without reference to any method of arrangement.

Some great old houses had gone down, and I mind well that I was greatly attracted by the first view of the Greyfriars Kirk that ever I had from that quarter.

It is a substantial, and somewhat handsome structure, in the French style, and with the curious high pitched roof which prevailed in the reign of William III.    "}]
