His proposals, like other commodious, salutary, and beneficial projects for the improvement of the place, were rejected ; as was likewise the Bcheme of an entry into the High Street of Edinburgh from St Cuthbert's or West Church, along the hill Bide by south and west of the Castle, which by a gradual ascent might be completed at no very considerable sum, to facilitate the easier conveyance of carriages from the south and west than by the West Bow, a most inconvenient and steep height for horses with coals and other articles for the citizens use : this might terminate the head of the causeway on the Castle Hill. A south entry to the High Street being much wanted for the same necessary purposes, has been of late proposed, but hitherto rejected also, from an excess of toll all needful carriages would be subjected to, which many of the inhabitants are unable to bear.

To the facts there stated, however, it must be added, that towards the end of his apprenticeship he did see a little practice, particularly in the workhouse of St Cuthbert's parish, of which Mr Johnston was the medical attendant.
