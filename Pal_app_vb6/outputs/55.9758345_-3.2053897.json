It contains a history of the world down to the arrival of St. Patrick in Ireland in the year 432, and from this period it is a history of Ireland down to 1320, a copy of which history is in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, in which it is written that this Abbey of Innisfallen, being ever esteemed a paradise and a secure sanctuary, the treasure and most valuable effects of the whole country were deposited with the clergy \u25a0 but in 1180 the abbey was plundered by Maoldain, son of Daniel O'Donoghue, and many of the clergy were slain, even in their cemetery, by the M'Carthys. We next visit O'Sullivan's Waterfall, which is on the western side of the Lower Lake, and is situated at the foot of the Toomies, a mountain about 2,413 feet high.

The surroundings of Edinburgh are very lovely, and there are many interesting places within easy distance worth seeing, such as Leith, Trinity, and Newhaven, celebrated for their fish and fishwives, who have a picturesque costume like the Stirling women\u2014a striped skirt and large blue cloak, with a creel of fish on their backs, and a peculiar cry of \" Caller rue! caller haddy!\" Also Granton, Portobello, Musselburgh, Roslin (where is the famous Roslin Chapel), and Hawthornden, Dalkeith, Newbattle Abbey, Dalhousie Castle, Hopetown House, and Queensferry. Having spent a very happy time in Edinburgh, where I made personal friends of Sir James Symes, Professor Bennett, and Christison (at whose houses I dined and spent some pleasant evenings), and with the family of Dr. Watson, it was with regret I said farewell to the old University, where I had passed some very pleasant days in taking my M.D. at the hands of Sir David Brewster, who placed a large cap\u2014 called \u00c6sculapius' cap\u2014on my head, and with a few words pronounced me Doctor of Medicine, I being attired in academical costume.

Tradition states that the saint died at the abbey of Saul, near Downpatrick, where the body was originally interred; but in 1186 the remains, with those of St. Columba and St. Bridget, were removed by De Courcey to Downpatrick, and all interred in the same grave within the walls of the present cathedral.
